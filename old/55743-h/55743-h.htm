<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>I have for years felt the need of a book to put
in the hands of those beginning the Christian
life that would tell them just how to make a
complete success of this new life upon which
they were entering. I could find no such book,
so I have been driven to write one. This book
aims to tell the young convert just what he most
needs to know. I hope that pastors and evangelists
and other Christian workers may find it a
good book to put in the hands of young converts.
I hope that it may also prove a helpful
book to many who have long been Christians
but have not made that headway in the Christian
life that they long for.</p>

<h1>How to Succeed in the Christian Life</h1>

<h2 id="I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">BEGINNING RIGHT</span></h2>

<p>There is nothing more important in the Christian
life than beginning right. If we begin right
we can go on right. If we begin wrong the
whole life that follows is likely to be wrong. If
any one who reads these pages has begun wrong,
it is a very simple matter to begin over again
and begin right. What the right beginning in
the Christian life is we are told in John 1: 12,
“But as many as <span class="smcap">received Him</span>, to them gave
He power to become the sons of God, even to
them that believe on His name.” The right
way to begin the Christian life is by receiving
Jesus Christ. To any one who receives Him,
He at once gives power to become a child of
God. If the reader of this book should be the
wickedest man on earth and should at this moment
receive Jesus Christ, that very instant he
would become a child of God. God says so in
the most unqualified way in the verse quoted
above. No one can become a child of God in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
any other way. No man, no matter how carefully
he has been reared, no matter how well he has been
sheltered from the vices and evils of this world,
is a child of God until he receives Jesus Christ.
We are “sons of God through faith in Christ
Jesus” (Gal. 3: 26, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>), and in no other way.</p>

<p>What does it mean to receive Jesus Christ?
It means to take Christ to be to yourself all
that God offers Him to be to everybody. Jesus
Christ is God’s gift. “For God so loved the
world that He gave His only begotten Son that
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish
but have everlasting life” (John 3: 16). Some
accept this wondrous gift of God. Every one
who does accept this gift becomes a child of
God. Many others refuse this wondrous gift of
God, and every one who refuses this gift of God
perishes. He is condemned already. “He that
believeth on the Son is not condemned, but he
that believeth not is condemned already because
he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten
Son of God” (John 3: 18).</p>

<p>What does God offer His Son to be to us?</p>

<p>1. First of all, <i>God offers Jesus to us to be our
sin-bearer</i>. We have all sinned. There is not a
man or woman or a boy or a girl who has not
sinned (Romans 3: 22, 23). If any of us say
that we have not sinned we are deceiving ourselves
and giving the lie to God (1 John 1: 8, 10).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Now we must each of us bear our own sin or
some one else must bear it in our place. If we
were to bear our own sins, it would mean we
must be banished forever from the presence of
God, for God is holy. “God is light and in Him
is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5). But God
Himself has provided another to bear our sins
in our place so that we should not need to bear
them ourselves. This sin-bearer is God’s own
Son, Jesus Christ, “For He hath made Him to
be sin for us who knew no sin that we might
be made the righteousness of God in Him”
(2 Cor. 5:21). When Jesus Christ died upon
the cross of Calvary He redeemed us from the
curse of the law by being made a curse in our
stead (Gal. 3:13). To receive Christ then is to
believe this testimony of God about His Son, to
believe that Jesus Christ did bear our sins in His
own body on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24), and to
trust God to forgive all our sins because Jesus
Christ has borne them in our place. “All we
like sheep have gone astray; we have turned
every one to his own way; and the Lord hath
laid on Him the iniquity of us all” (Is. 53:6).
Our own good works, past, present or future have
nothing to do with the forgiveness of our sins.
Our sins are forgiven, not because of any good
works that we do, they are forgiven because of
the atoning work of Christ upon the cross of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Calvary in our place. If we rest in this atoning
work we shall do good works, but our good
works will be the outcome of our being
saved and the outcome of our believing on
Christ as our sin-bearer. Our good works will
not be the ground of our salvation, but the result
of our salvation, and the proof of it. We
must be very careful not to mix in our good
works at all as the ground of salvation. We
are not forgiven because of Christ’s death <i>and
our good works</i>, we are forgiven solely and entirely
because of Christ’s death. To see this
clearly is the right beginning of the true Christian
life.</p>

<p>2. <i>God offers Jesus to us as our deliverer from
the power of sin.</i> Jesus not only died, He rose
again. To-day He is a living Saviour. He has
all power in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28: 18).
He has power to keep the weakest sinner from
falling (Jude 24). He is able to save not only
from the uttermost but “to the uttermost” all
that come unto the Father through Him.
(Wherefore He is able to save to the uttermost
them that draw near unto God through
Him, seeing that He ever liveth to make intercession
for them.—Heb. 7: 25, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>) “If the
Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be
free indeed” (John 8: 36). To receive Jesus is
to believe this that God tells us in His Word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
about Him, to believe that He did rise from the
dead, to believe that He does now live, to believe
that He has power to keep us from falling,
to believe that He has power to keep us from
the power of sin day by day, and just trust Him
to do it.</p>

<p>This is the secret of daily victory over sin.
If we try to fight sin in our own strength,
we are bound to fail. If we just look up to the
risen Christ to keep us every day and every hour,
He will keep us. Through the crucified Christ
we get deliverance from the guilt of sin, our
sins are all blotted out, we are free from all condemnation;
but it is through the risen Christ
that we get daily victory over the power of sin.
Some receive Christ as a sin-bearer and thus find
pardon, but do not get beyond that, and so their
life is one of daily failure. Others receive Him
as their risen Saviour also, and thus enter into
an experience of victory over sin. To begin
right we must take Him not only as our sin-bearer,
and thus find pardon; but we must also
take Him as our risen Saviour, our Deliverer
from the power of sin, our Keeper, and thus find
daily victory over sin.</p>

<p>3. But <i>God offers Jesus to us, not only as our
sin-bearer and our Deliverer from the power of sin,
but He also offers Him to us as our Lord and
King</i>. We read in Acts 2: 36, “Let all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath
made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified,
both Lord and Christ.” Lord means Divine
Master, and Christ means anointed King. To
receive Jesus is to take Him as our Divine
Master, as the One to whom we yield the absolute
confidence of our intellects, the One whose word
we believe absolutely, the One whom we will
believe though many of the wisest of men may
question or deny the truth of His teachings; and
as our King to whom we gladly yield the absolute
control of our lives, so that the question
from this time on is never going to be, what
would I like to do or what do others tell me to
do, or what do others do, but the whole question
is <span class="smcap">what would my King Jesus have me do</span>? A
right beginning involves an unconditional surrender
to the Lordship and Kingship of Jesus.</p>

<p>The failure to realize that Jesus is Lord and
King, as well as Saviour, has led to many a false
start in the Christian life. We begin with Him
as our Saviour, as our sin-bearer and our Deliverer
from the power of sin, but we must not
end with Him merely as Saviour, we must know
Him as Lord and King. There is nothing more
important in a right beginning of the Christian
life than an unconditional surrender, both of the
thoughts and the conduct to Jesus. Say from
your heart and say it again and again, “<i>All</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Jesus.” Many fail because they shrink back
from this entire surrender. They wish to serve
Jesus with half their heart, and part of themselves
and part of their possessions. To hold
back anything from Jesus means a wretched life
of stumbling and failure.</p>

<p>The life of entire surrender is a joyous life all
along the way. If you have never done it before,
go alone with God to-day, get down on your
knees and say, “All for Jesus,” and mean it.
Say it very earnestly; say it from the bottom of
your heart. Stay there until you realize what it
means and what you are doing. It is a wondrous
step forward when one really takes it. If you
have taken it already, take it again, take it often.
It always has fresh meaning and brings fresh
blessedness. In this absolute surrender is found
the key to the truth. Doubts rapidly disappear
for one who surrenders all (John 7: 17). In this
absolute surrender is found the secret of power
in prayer (1 John 3: 22). In this absolute surrender
is found the supreme condition of receiving
the Holy Ghost (Acts 5: 32).</p>

<p>Taking Christ as your Lord and King involves
obedience to His will as far as you know it in
each smallest detail of life. There are those who
tell us that they have taken Christ as their Lord
and King who at the same time are disobeying
Him daily in business, in domestic life, in social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
life and in personal conduct Such persons are
deceiving themselves. You have not taken Jesus
as your Lord and King if you are not striving to
obey Him in everything each day. He Himself
says, “Why call ye Me ‘Lord, Lord!’ and do
not the things that I say?” (Luke 6: 46).</p>

<p>To sum it all up, the right way to begin the
Christian life is to accept Jesus Christ as your
sin-bearer and to trust God to forgive your sins
because Jesus Christ died in your place; to
accept Him as your risen Saviour who ever lives
to make intercession for you, and who has all
power to keep you, and to trust Him to keep
you from day to day; and to accept Him as your
Lord and King to whom you surrender the
absolute control of your thoughts and of your
life. This is the right beginning, the only right
beginning of the Christian life. If you have
made this beginning, all that follows will be comparatively
easy. If you have not made this
beginning, make it now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE OPEN CONFESSION OF CHRIST</span></h2>

<p>Having begun the Christian life right by
taking the proper attitude towards Christ in a
private transaction between Himself and yourself,
the next step is an open confession of the
relationship that now exists between yourself
and Jesus Christ. Jesus says in Matt. 10: 32,
“Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before
men, him will I confess also before My Father
which is in heaven.” He demands a public confession.
He demands it for your own sake.
This is the path of blessing. Many attempt to
be disciples of Jesus and not let the world know
it. No one has ever succeeded in that attempt.
To be a secret disciple means to be no disciple
at all. If one really has received Christ he cannot
keep it to himself. “For out of the abundance
of the heart the mouth speaketh” (Matt.
12: 34). So important is the public confession
of Christ that Paul puts it first in his statement
of the conditions of salvation. He says, “If thou
shalt <i>confess with thy mouth</i> the Lord Jesus and
shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised
Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with the heart man believeth unto righteousness;
and with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation” (Rom. 10: 9, 10). The life of confession
is the life of full salvation. Indeed, the
life of confession is the life of the only real
salvation. When we confess Christ before men
down here, He confesses us before the Father in
heaven and the Father gives us the Holy Spirit
as the seal of our salvation.</p>

<p>It is not enough that we confess Christ just
once, as, for example, when we are confirmed, or
when we unite with the church, or when we
come forward in a revival meeting. We should
confess Christ constantly. We should not be
ashamed of our Lord and King. We should let
people know that we are on His side. In the
home, in the church, at our work, and at our
play, we should let others know where we stand.
Of course, we should not parade our Christianity
or our piety, but we should leave no one in
doubt whether we belong to Christ. We should
let it be seen that we glory in Him as our Lord
and King.</p>

<p>The failure to confess Christ is one of the most
frequent causes of backsliding. Christians get
into new relationships where they are not known
as Christians and where they are tempted to conceal
the fact; they yield to the temptation and
they soon find themselves drifting. The more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
you make of Jesus Christ, the more He will
make of you. It will save you from many a
temptation if the fact is clearly known that you
are one who acknowledges Christ as Lord in all
things.</p>

<span class="smaller">ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</span></h2>

<p>If one is to have the fullest measure of joy and
power in Christian service, he must know that his
sins are forgiven, that he is a child of God, and
that he has eternal life. It is the believer’s
privilege to <i>know</i> that he has eternal life. John
says in 1 John 5: 13, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>, “These things have
I written unto you, <i>that ye may know</i> that ye
have eternal life, even unto you that believe on
the name of the Son of God.” John wrote this
first epistle for the express purpose that any one
who believes on the name of the Son of God
<i>might know</i> that he has eternal life.</p>

<p>There are those who tell us that no one can
know that he has eternal life until he is dead and
has been before the judgment seat of God, but God
Himself tells us that we may know. To deny the
possibility of the believer’s knowing that he has
eternal life is to say that the First Epistle of John
was written in vain, and it is to insult the Holy
Spirit who is its real author. Again Paul tells
us in Acts 13: 39, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>, “By Him (that is by
Christ) every one that believeth <i>is justified</i> from
all things.” So every one that believeth in Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
may know that he is justified from all things.
He may know it because the Word of God says
so. Again John tells us in John 1: 12, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>,
“But <i>as many as received Him</i> (that is Jesus
Christ) to them gave He the right to become
children of God, even to them that believe on
His name.” Here is a definite and unmistakable
declaration that every one who receives Jesus
becomes a child of God. Therefore every believer
in Jesus may know that he is a child of
God. He may know it on the surest of all
grounds, <i>i. e.</i>, because the Word of God asserts
that he is a child of God.</p>

<p>But how may any individual know that he has
eternal life? He may know it on the very best
ground of knowledge, that is through the testimony
of God Himself as given in the Bible.
The testimony of Scripture is the testimony of
God. What the Scriptures say is absolutely
sure. What the Scriptures say God says. Now
in John 3: 36 the Scriptures say, “He that believeth
on the Son <i>hath</i> everlasting life.” Any
one of us may know whether we believe on the
Son or not. Whether we have that real faith in
Christ that leads us to receive Him. If we have
this faith in Christ we have God’s own written
testimony that we have eternal life, that our sins
are forgiven, that we are the children of God.
We may feel forgiven, or we may not feel forgiven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but that does not matter. It is not a question
of what we feel but of what God says. God’s
Word is always to be believed. Our own feelings
are oftentimes to be doubted. There are
many who are led to doubt their sins are forgiven,
to doubt that they have everlasting life, to
doubt that they are saved, because they do not
feel forgiven, or do not feel that they have everlasting
life, or do not feel that they are saved.
Because you do not feel it is no reason why you
should doubt it.</p>

<p>Suppose that you were sentenced to imprisonment
and that your friends secured a pardon
for you. The legal document announcing
your pardon is brought to you. You read it
and know you are pardoned because the legal
document says so, but the news is so good
and so sudden that you are dazed by it. You
do not realize that you are pardoned. Some one
comes to you and says, “Are you pardoned?”
What would you reply? You would say, “Yes,
I am pardoned.” Then he asks, “Do you feel
pardoned?” You reply, “No, I do not feel
pardoned. It is so sudden, it is so wonderful, I
cannot realize it.” Then he says to you, “But
how can you know that you are pardoned if you
do not feel it?” You would hold out the document
and you would say, “This says so.” The
time would come, after you had read the document<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
over and over again and believed it, when
you would not only know you were pardoned
because the document said so but you would
feel it. Now the Bible is God’s authoritative
document declaring that every one that believeth
in Jesus is justified; declaring that every one
that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life;
declaring that every one who receives Jesus is a
child of God. If any one asks you if your sins
are all forgiven, reply, “Yes, I know they are
because God says so.” If they ask you if you
know that you are a child of God, reply, “Yes,
I know I am a child of God because God says
so.” If they ask you if you have everlasting
life, reply, “Yes, I know I have everlasting life
because God says so. God says, ‘He that believeth
on the Son hath everlasting life.’ I know
I believe on the Son, and therefore I know I
have eternal life—because God says so.” You
may not feel it yet but if you will keep meditating
upon God’s statement and believing what
God says, the time will come when you will
feel it.</p>

<p>For one who believes on the Son of God to
doubt that he has eternal life is for him to make
God a liar. “He that believeth on the Son of
God hath the witness in him. He that believeth
not God, hath made Him a liar because he hath
not believed in the witness that God hath borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
concerning His Son and the witness is this, that
God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in
His Son. He that hath the Son hath the life:
he that hath not the Son of God hath not the
life” (1 John 5: 10-12, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>). Any one who
does not believe God’s testimony that He has
given unto us eternal life and that this life is in
His Son and that he that hath the Son hath the
life, makes God a liar.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said “it is presumption for any
one to say that he knows he is saved, or to say
that he knows that he has eternal life.” But is it
presumption to believe God? Is it not rather
presumption not to believe God, to make God a
liar? When you who believe on the Son of God
and yet doubt that you have eternal life, you make
God a liar. When Jesus said to the woman who
was a sinner, “Thy sins are forgiven” (Luke
7: 48), was it presumption for her to go out and
say, “I know my sins are all forgiven”? Would
it not have been presumption for her to have
doubted for a moment that her sins were all forgiven?
Jesus had said that they were forgiven.
For her to doubt it would have been for her to give
the lie to Jesus. Is it then any more presumption
for the believer to-day to say, “My sins are
all forgiven, I have eternal life,” when God says
in His written testimony to every one that believeth,
“You are justified from all things” (Acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
13: 39), “You have eternal life” (John 3: 36;
1 John 5: 13)?</p>

<p>Be very sure first of all that you really do believe
on the name of the Son of God; that you really
have received Jesus. If you are sure of this
then never doubt for a moment that your sins
are all forgiven, never doubt for a moment that
you are a child of God, never doubt for a moment
that you have everlasting life. If Satan
comes and whispers, “Your sins are not forgiven,”
point Satan to the Word of God and say,
“God says my sins are forgiven and I know
they are.” If Satan whispers, “Well perhaps
you don’t believe on Him,” then say, “Well if I
never did before I will now.” And then go out
rejoicing, knowing that your sins are forgiven,
knowing that you are a child of God, knowing
that you have everlasting life.</p>

<p>There are doubtless many who say they know
they have eternal life who really do not believe
on the name of the Son of God, who have not
really received Jesus. This is not true assurance.
It has no sure foundation in the Word of God
who cannot lie. If we wish to get assurance of
salvation we must first get saved. The reason
why many have not the assurance that they are
saved is because they are not saved. They
ought not to have assurance. What they need
first is salvation. But if you have received Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in the way described in the first chapter, <span class="smcapuc">YOU ARE
SAVED</span>, you are a child of God, your sins are
forgiven. Believe it, know it. Rejoice in it.</p>

<p>Having settled it, let it remain settled. Never
doubt it. You may make mistakes, you may
stumble, you may fall, but even if you do, if you
have really received Jesus, know that your sins
are forgiven and rise from your fall and go forward
in the glad assurance that there is nothing
between you and God.</p>

<h2 id="IV">IV<br />
<span class="smaller">RECEIVING THE HOLY SPIRIT</span></h2>

<p>When the Apostle Paul came to Ephesus, he
found a little group of twelve disciples of Christ.
There was something about these twelve disciples
that struck Paul unfavourably. We are not
told what it was. It may be that he did not find
in them that overflowing joyfulness that one learns
to expect in all Christians who have really entered
into the fullness of blessing that there is for
them in Christ. It may be that Paul was troubled
at the fact that there were only twelve of
them, thinking that if these twelve were what
they ought to be, there would certainly have been
more than twelve of them by this time. Whatever
it may have been that impressed Paul unfavourably,
he went right to the root of the difficulty
at once by putting to them the question,
“Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed?”
(Acts 19: 2, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>). It came out at once
that they had not received the Holy Ghost, that
in fact they did not know that the Holy Ghost
had been given. Then Paul told them that the
Holy Ghost had been given, and also showed
them just what they must do to receive the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Ghost then and there, and before that gathering
was over the Holy Ghost came upon them.
From that day on there was a different state of
affairs in Ephesus. A great revival sprang up at
once so that the whole city was shaken, “So
mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed”
(Acts 19: 20). Paul’s question to these young
disciples in Ephesus should be put to young
disciples everywhere, “Have ye received the
Holy Ghost?” In <i>receiving the Holy Spirit</i> is
the great secret of joyfulness in our own hearts,
of victory over sin, of power in prayer, and of
effective service.</p>

<p>Every one who has truly received Jesus must
have the Holy Spirit dwelling in him in some
sense; but in many believers, though the Holy
Spirit dwells in them, He dwells way back in
some hidden sanctuary of their being, back of
consciousness. It is something quite different,
something far better than this, to receive the
Holy Spirit in the sense that Paul meant in his
question. To receive the Holy Spirit in such a
sense that one knows experimentally that he has
received the Holy Spirit, to receive the Holy
Spirit in such a sense that we are conscious of
the joy with which He fills our hearts different
from any joy that we have ever known in the
world; to receive the Holy Spirit in such a sense
that He rules our life and produces within us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
ever increasing measure the fruit of the Spirit,
love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance; to receive the
Holy Spirit in such a sense that we are conscious
of His drawing our hearts out in prayer in a way
that is not of ourselves; to receive the Holy
Spirit in such a sense that we are conscious of
His help when we witness for Christ, when we
speak to others individually and try to lead them
to accept Christ, or when we teach a Sunday-school
class, or speak in public, or do any other
work for the Master. Have you received the
Holy Spirit? If you have not, let me tell you
how you may.</p>

<p>1. First of all in order to receive the Holy
Spirit, one must be resting in the death of Christ
on the cross for us as the sole and all-sufficient
ground upon which God pardons all our sins and
forgives us.</p>

<p>2. In order to receive the Holy Spirit we
must put away every known sin. We should go
to our heavenly Father and ask Him to search us
through and through and bring to light anything
in our life, our outward life or our inward life,
that is wrong in His sight, and if He does bring
anything to light that is displeasing to Him, we
should put it away, no matter how dear it is to
us. There must be a complete renunciation of
all sin in order to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>3. In the third place, in order to receive the
Holy Spirit, there must be an open confession of
Christ before the world. The Holy Spirit is not
given to those who are trying to be disciples in
secret, but to those who obey Christ and publicly
confess Him before the world.</p>

<p>4. In the fourth place, in order to receive the
Holy Spirit, there must be an absolute surrender
of our lives to God. You must go to Him and
say, “Heavenly Father, here I am. Thou hast
bought me with a price. I am Thy property. I
renounce all claim to do my own will, all
claim to govern my own life, all claim to have
my own way. I give myself up unreservedly
to Thee—all I am and all I have. Send
me where Thou wilt, use me as Thou wilt, do
with me what Thou wilt—I am Thine.” If we
hold anything back from God, no matter how
small it may seem, that spoils it all. But if we
surrender all to God, then God will give all that
He has to us. There are some who shrink from
this absolute surrender to God, but absolute surrender
to God is simply absolute surrender to infinite
love. Surrender to the Father, to the
Father whose love is not only wiser than any
earthly father’s, but more tender than any earthly
mother’s.</p>

<p>5. In order to receive the Holy Spirit there
should be definite asking for the Holy Spirit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Our Lord Jesus says in Luke 11: 13, “If ye
then, being evil, know how to give good gifts
unto your children: how much more shall your
heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them
that ask Him?” Just ask God to give you the
Holy Spirit and expect Him to do it, because He
says He will.</p>

<p>6. Last of all, in order to receive the Holy
Spirit, there must be faith, simply taking God at
His Word. No matter how positive any promise
of God’s Word may be, we enjoy it personally
only when we believe. Our Lord Jesus says,
“All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for,
believe that ye have received them, and ye shall
have them” (Mark 11: 24, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>). When you
pray for the Holy Spirit you have prayed for
something according to God’s will and therefore
you may know that your prayer is heard and
that you have what you asked of Him (1 John
5: 14, 15). You may feel no different, but do not
look at your feelings but at God’s promise.
Believe the prayer is heard, believe that God has
given you the Holy Spirit and you will afterwards
have in actual experience what you have
received in simple faith on the bare promise of
God’s Word.</p>

<p>It is well to go often alone and kneel down
and look up to the Holy Spirit and put into His
hands anew the entire control of your life. Ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Him to take the control of your thoughts, the
control of your imagination, the control of your
affections, the control of your desires, the control
of your ambitions, the control of your choices,
the control of your purposes, the control of your
words, the control of your actions, the control of
everything, and just expect Him to do it. The
whole secret of victory in the Christian life is
letting the Holy Spirit who dwells within you,
have undisputed right of way in the entire conduct
of your life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="V">V<br />
<span class="smaller">LOOKING UNTO JESUS</span></h2>

<p>If we are to run with patience the race that is
set before us, we must always keep looking unto
Jesus (Heb. 12: 1-3). One of the simplest and
yet one of the mightiest secrets of abiding joy
and victory is to <i>never lose sight of Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>1. First of all <i>we must keep looking at Jesus
as the ground of our acceptance before God</i>.
Over and over again Satan will make an attempt
to discourage us by bringing up our sins and
failures and thus try to convince us that we are
not children of God, or not saved. If he succeeds
in getting us to keep looking at and brooding
over our sins, he will soon get us discouraged,
and discouragement means failure. But if we
will keep looking at what God looks at, the death
of Jesus Christ in our place that completely
atones for every sin that we ever committed, we
will never be discouraged because of the greatness
of our sins. We shall see that while our
sins are great, very great, that they have all been
atoned for. Every time Satan brings up one of
our sins, we shall see that Jesus Christ has redeemed
us from its curse by being made a curse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in our place (Gal. 3: 13). We shall see that
while in ourselves we are full of unrighteousness,
nevertheless in Christ we are made the righteousness
of God, because Christ was made to be sin
in our place (2 Cor. 5: 21). We will see that
every sin that Satan taunts us about has been
borne and settled forever (1 Pet. 2: 24; Is.
53: 6). We shall always be able to sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Jesus paid my debt,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">All the debt I owe;</div>
<div class="verse">Sin had left a crimson stain,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">He washed it white as snow.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If you are this moment troubled about any sin
that you have ever committed, either in the past
or in the present, just look at Jesus on the cross;
believe what God tells you about Him, that this
sin which troubles you was laid upon Him
(Is. 53: 6). Thank God that the sin is all
settled; be full of gratitude to Jesus who bore
it in your place and trouble about it no more.
It is an act of base ingratitude to God to brood
over sins that He in His infinite love has cancelled.
Keep looking at Christ on the cross and
walk always in the sunlight of God’s favour.
This favour of God has been purchased for you
at great cost. Gratitude demands that you
should always believe in it and walk in the light
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>2. In the second place, <i>we must keep looking
at Jesus as our risen Saviour, who has all
power in heaven and on earth and is able to keep
us every day and every hour</i>. Are you tempted
to do some wrong at this moment? If you are,
remember that Jesus rose from the dead, remember
that at this moment He is living at the
right hand of God in the glory; remember that
He has all power in heaven and on earth, and
that, therefore, He can give you victory right
now. Believe what God tells you in His Word
that Jesus has power to save you this moment
“to the uttermost” (Heb. 7: 25). Believe that He
has power to give you victory over this sin that
now besets you. Ask Him to give you victory,
expect Him to do it. In this way by looking
unto the risen Christ for victory you may have
victory over sin every day, every hour, every
moment. “Remember Jesus Christ risen from
the dead” (2 Tim. 2: 8, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>).</p>

<p>God has called every one of us to a victorious
life, and the secret of this victorious life is always
looking to the risen Christ for victory. Through
looking to Christ crucified we obtain pardon and
enjoy peace. Through looking to the risen
Christ we obtain present victory over the power
of sin. If you have lost sight of the risen Christ
and have yielded to temptation, confess your sin
and know that it is forgiven because God says so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
(1 John 1: 9) and look to Jesus, the risen One,
again to give you victory now and keep looking
to Him.</p>

<p>3. In the third place, <i>we must keep looking
to Jesus as the One whom we should follow in
our daily conduct</i>. Our Lord Jesus says to us,
His disciples to-day, as He said to His early disciples,
“Follow Me.” The whole secret of true
Christian conduct can be summed up in these two
words “Follow Me.” “He that saith he abideth
in Him ought himself so to walk <i>even as He
walked</i>” (1 John 2: 6). One of the commonest
causes of failure in Christian life is found in the
attempt to follow some good man, whom we
greatly admire. No man and no woman, no
matter how good, can be safely followed. If we
follow any man or woman, we are bound to go
astray. There never has been but one absolutely
perfect Man upon this earth—the Man
Christ Jesus. If we try to follow any other man
we are more sure to imitate his faults than his
excellencies. Look at Jesus and Jesus only as
your Guide.</p>

<p>If at any time you are in any perplexity as to
what to do, simply ask the question, What would
Jesus do? Ask God by His Holy Spirit to show
you what Jesus would do. Study your Bible to
find out what Jesus did do and follow Jesus.
Even though no one else seems to be following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Jesus, be sure that you follow Him. Do not
spend your time or thought in criticising others
because they do not follow Jesus. See that you
follow Him yourself. When you are wasting
your time criticising others for not following
Jesus, Jesus is always saying to you, “What is
that to thee; follow <span class="smcapuc">THOU</span> Me” (John 21: 22).
The question for you is not what following Jesus
may involve for other people. The question is
what does following Jesus mean for you?</p>

<p>This is the really simple life, the life of simply
following Jesus. Many perplexing questions will
come to you, but the most perplexing question
will soon become as clear as day if you determine
with all your heart to follow Jesus in everything.
Satan will always be ready to whisper to you,
“Such and such a good man does it,” but all
you need to do is to answer, “It matters not to
me what this or that man may do or not do.
The only question to me is, What would Jesus
do?” There is wonderful freedom in this life
of simply following Jesus. This path is straight
and plain. But the path of the one who tries to
shape his conduct by observing the conduct of
others is full of twists and turns and pitfalls.
Keep looking at Jesus. Follow on trustingly
where He leads. This is the path of the just
which shineth more and more unto the perfect
day (Prov. 4: 18). He is the Light of the World,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
any one who follows Him shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life all along the
way (John 8: 12).</p>

<h2 id="VI">VI<br />
<span class="smaller">CHURCH MEMBERSHIP</span></h2>

<p>No young Christian and no old Christian can
have real success in the Christian life without the
fellowship of other believers. The church is a
divine institution, built by Jesus Christ Himself.
It is the one institution that abides. Other
institutions come and go; they do their work for
their day and disappear, but the church will continue
to the end. “The gates of hell shall not
prevail against it” (Matt. 16: 18). The church
is made up of men and women, imperfect men
and women, and consequently is an imperfect
institution, but none the less it is of divine origin
and God loves it, and every believer should
realize that he belongs to it and should openly
take his place in it and bear his responsibilities
regarding it.</p>

<p>The true church consists of all true believers,
all who are united to Jesus Christ by a living
faith in Himself. In its outward organization
at the present time, it is divided into numberless
sects and local congregations, but in spite of
these divisions the true church is one. It has
one Lord, Jesus Christ. It has one faith, faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in Him as Saviour, Divine Lord and only King;
one baptism, the baptism in the one Spirit into
the one body (Eph. 4: 4, 5; 1 Cor. 12: 13).
But each individual Christian needs the fellowship
of individual fellow believers. The outward
expression of this fellowship is in membership in
some organized body of believers. If we hold
aloof from all organized churches, hoping thus
to have a broader fellowship with all believers
belonging to all the churches, we deceive ourselves.
We will miss the helpfulness that comes
from intimate union with some local congregation.
I have known many well-meaning persons
who have held aloof from membership in
any specific organization, and I have never known
a person who has done this, whose own spiritual
life has not suffered by it. On the day of Pentecost
the three thousand who were converted were
at once baptized and were added to the church
(Acts 2: 41, 47), and “They continued steadfastly
in the apostle’s doctrine and fellowship,
and in breaking of bread and in prayers.” Their
example is the one to follow. If you have really
received Jesus Christ, hunt up as soon as possible
some company of others who have received
Jesus Christ and unite yourself with them.</p>

<p>In many communities there may be no choice
of churches, for there is only one. In other communities
one will be faced with the question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
“With what body of believers shall I unite?”
Do not waste your time looking for a perfect
church. There is no perfect church. If you
wait until you find a perfect church before you
unite with any, you will unite with none, and
thus you will belong to a church in which you
are the only member and that is the most imperfect
church of all. I would rather belong to
the most imperfect Christian church I ever knew
than not to belong to any church at all. The
local churches in Paul’s day were very imperfect
institutions. Let one read the epistles to the
Corinthians and see how imperfect was the
church in Corinth, see how much there was
that was evil in it, and yet Paul never thought
of advising any believer in Corinth to get out of
this imperfect church. He did tell them to come
out of heathenism, to come out from fellowship
with infidels (2 Cor. 6: 14-18), but not a word
on coming out of the imperfect church in Corinth.
He did tell the church in Corinth to separate
from their membership certain persons whose
lives were wrong (1 Cor. 5: 11, 12), but he did
not tell the individual members of the church in
Corinth to get out of the church because these
persons had not yet been separated from their
fellowship.</p>

<p>As you cannot find a perfect church, find the
best church you can. Unite with a church where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
they believe in the Bible and where they preach
the Bible. Avoid the churches where words are
spoken open or veiled that have a tendency to
undermine your faith in the Bible as a reliable
revelation from God Himself, the all-sufficient
rule of faith and practice. Unite with a church
where there is a spirit of prayer, where the prayer-meetings
are well kept up. Unite with a church
that has a real active interest in the salvation of
the lost, where young Christians are looked after
and helped, where minister and people have a
love for the poor and outcast, a church that
regards its mission in this world to be the same
as the mission of Christ, “to seek and to save
the lost.” As to denominational differences,
other things being equal, unite with that denomination
whose ideas of doctrine and of government
and of the ordinances are most closely
akin to your own. But it is better to unite
with a live church of some other denomination
than to unite with a dead church of your own.
We live in a day when denominational differences
are becoming ever less and less, and oftentimes
they are of no practical consequence whatever;
and one will often feel more at home in a church
of some other denomination than in any accessible
church of his own denomination. The
things that divide the denominations are insignificant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
compared with the great fundamental
truths and purposes and faith that unite them.</p>

<p>If you cannot find the church that agrees
with the pattern set forth above, find the church
that comes nearest to it. Go into that church
and by prayer and by work try to bring that
church as nearly as you can to the pattern of
what you think a church of Christ ought to be.
But do not waste your strength in criticism
against either church or minister. Seek for what
is good in the church and in the minister and do
your best to strengthen it. Hold aloof firmly,
though unobtrusively, from what is wrong and
seek to correct it. Do not be discouraged if
you cannot correct it in a day or a week or a
month or a year. Patient love and prayer and
effort will tell in time. Drawing off by yourself
and snarling and grumbling will do no good.
They will simply make you and the truths for
which you stand repulsive.</p>

<h2 id="VII">VII<br />
<span class="smaller">BIBLE STUDY</span></h2>

<p>There is nothing more important for the development
of the spiritual life of the Christian
than regular, systematic Bible study. It is as
true in the spiritual life as it is in the physical
life that health depends upon what we eat and
how much we eat. The soul’s proper food is
found in one book, the Bible. Of course, a
true minister of the gospel will feed us on the
Word of God, but that is not enough. He feeds
us but one or two days in the week and we need
to be fed every day. Furthermore, it will not
do to depend upon being fed by others. We
must learn to feed ourselves. If we study the
Bible for ourselves as we ought to study it, we
shall be in a large measure independent of
human teachers. Even if we are so unfortunate
as to have for our minister a man who is himself
ignorant of the truth of God we shall still be
safe from harm.</p>

<p>We live in a day in which false doctrine
abounds on every hand and the only Christian
who is safe from being led into error is the one
who studies his Bible for himself daily. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Apostle Paul warned the elders of the church in
Ephesus that the time was soon coming when
grievous wolves should enter in among them not
sparing the flock and when of their own selves
men should arise speaking perverse things to
draw away the disciples after them, but he told
them how to be safe even in such perilous times
as these. He said, “I commend you to God and
to the Word of His grace, which is able to build
you up and to give you an inheritance among
them which are sanctified.” Through meditation
on the Word of God’s grace they would be
safe even in the midst of abounding error on the
part of the leaders in the church (Acts 20:
29-32). Writing later to the Bishop of the
church in Ephesus Paul said, “But evil men and
impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving
and being deceived” (2 Tim. 3: 13, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>) but he
goes on to tell Bishop Timothy how he and his
fellow believers could be safe even in such times of
increasing peril as were coming. That way was
through the study of the Holy Scriptures, which
are able to make wise unto salvation (2 Tim.
3: 14, 15). “All Scripture,” he adds, “is
given by inspiration of God and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness that the man of God may
be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good
works.” That is to say, through the study of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the Bible one will be sound in doctrine, will be
led to see his sins and put them away, will find
discipline in the righteous life and attain unto
complete equipment for all good works. Our
spiritual health, our growth, our strength, our
victory over sin, our soundness in doctrine, our
joy and peace in Christ, our cleansing from
inward and outward sin, our fitness for service,
all depend upon the study of the Word of God.
The one who neglects his Bible is bound to
make a failure of the Christian life. The one
who studies his Bible in the right spirit and by a
true method is bound to make a success of the
Christian life.</p>

<p>This brings us face to face with the question,
“What is the right way to study the Bible?”</p>

<p>1. First of all, we should <i>study it daily</i>
(Acts 17: 11). This is of prime importance.
No matter how good the methods of Bible study
that one follows may be, no matter how much
time one may put into Bible study now and then,
the best results can only be secured when one
makes it a matter of principle never to let a
single day go by without earnest Bible study.
This is the only safe course. Any day that is
allowed to pass without faithful Bible study is a
day thrown open to the advent into our hearts
and lives of error or of sin. The writer has
been a Christian for more than a quarter of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
century and yet to-day he would not dare to
allow even a single day to pass over his head
without listening to the voice of God as it speaks
to him through the pages of His Book. It is at
this point that many fall away. They grow
careless and let a day pass, or even several days
pass, without going alone with God and letting
Him speak to them through His Word. Mr.
Moody once wisely said, “In prayer we talk to
God. In Bible study, God talks to us, and we
had better let God do most of the talking.”</p>

<p>A regular time should be set apart each day
for the study of the Bible. I do not think it is
well as a rule to say that we shall study so many
chapters in a day, for that leads to undue haste
and skimming and thoughtlessness, but it is well
to set apart a certain length of time each day for
Bible study. Some can give more time to Bible
study than others, but no one ought to give less
than fifteen minutes a day. I set the time so low
in order that no one may be discouraged at the
outset. If a young Christian should set out to
give an hour or two hours a day to Bible study,
there is a strong probability that he would not
keep to the resolution and he might become discouraged.
Yet I know of many very busy people
who have given the first hour of every day for
years to Bible study and some who have given
even two hours a day. The late Earl Cairns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Lord Chancellor of England, was one of the
busiest men of his day, but Lady Cairns told
me a few months ago that no matter how late
he reached home at night he always arose
at the same early hour for prayer and Bible
study. She said, “We would sometimes get
home from Parliament at two o’clock in the
morning, but Lord Cairns would always arise
at the same early hour to pray and study the
Bible.” Lord Cairns is reported as saying,
“If I have had any success in life, I attribute
it to the habit of giving the first two hours of
each day to Bible study and prayer.”</p>

<p>It is important that one choose the right time
for this study. Wherever it is possible, the best
time for this study is immediately after arising in
the morning. The worst time of all is the last
thing at night. Of course, it is well to give a
little while just before we retire to Bible reading,
in order that God’s voice may be the last to
which we listen, but the bulk of our Bible study
should be done at an hour when our minds are
clearest and strongest. Whatever time is set
apart for Bible study should be kept sacredly for
that purpose.</p>

<p>2. We should <i>study the Bible systematically</i>.
Much time is frittered away in random study of
the Bible. The same amount of time put into
systematic study would yield far larger results.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Have a definite place where you are studying
and have a definite plan of study. A good way
for a young Christian to begin the study of the
Bible is to read the Gospel of John. When you
have read it through once, begin and read it again
until you have gone over the Gospel five times.
Then read the Gospel of Luke five times in the
same way; then read the Acts of the Apostles
five times, then 1 Thessalonians five times, then
1 John five times, then Romans five times, then
Ephesians five times.</p>

<p>By this time you will be ready to take up a
more thorough method of Bible study. A good
method is to begin at Genesis and read the Bible
through chapter by chapter. Read each chapter
through several times and then answer the following
questions on the chapter:</p>

<p>(1) What is the principal subject of the chapter?
(State the principal contents of the chapter
in a single phrase or sentence.)</p>

<p>(2) What is the truth most clearly taught and
most emphasized in the chapter?</p>

<p>(3) What is the best lesson?</p>

<p>(4) What is the best verse?</p>

<p>(5) Who are the principal people mentioned?</p>

<p>(6) What does the chapter teach about Jesus
Christ? Go through the entire Bible in this
way.</p>

<p>Another and more thorough method of Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
chapter study, which cannot be applied to every
chapter in the Bible, but which will yield excellent
results when applied to some of the more
important chapters of the Bible, is as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Read the chapter for to-day’s study five
times, reading it aloud at least once. Each new
reading will bring out some new point.</p>

<p>(2) Divide the chapter into its natural divisions
and find headings for each division that
describes in the most striking way the contents
of that division. For example, suppose the chapter
studied is 1 John 5. You might divide it in
this way: First division, verses 1-3, The Believer’s
Noble Parentage. Second division, verses
4, 5, The Believer’s Glorious Victory. Third
division, verses 6-10, The Believer’s Sure Ground
of Faith. Fourth division, verses 11, 12, The
Believer’s Priceless Possession. Fifth division,
verse 13, The Believer’s Blessed Assurance.
Sixth division, verses 14, 15, The Believer’s Unquestioning
Confidence. Seventh division, verses
16, 17, The Believer’s Great Power and Responsibility.
Eighth division, verses 18, 19, The Believer’s
Perfect Security. Ninth division, verse
20, The Believer’s Precious Knowledge. Tenth
division, verse 21, The Believer’s Constant
Duty.</p>

<p>(3) Note the important differences between the
Authorized Version and the Revised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) Write down the leading facts of the chapter
in their proper order.</p>

<p>(5) Make a note of the persons mentioned in
the chapter and of any light thrown upon their
character.</p>

<p>(6) Note the principal lessons of the chapter.
It would be well to classify these. For instance
lessons about God; lessons about Christ, lessons
about the Holy Spirit, etc.</p>

<p>(7) Find the central truth of the chapter.</p>

<p>(8) The key verse of the chapter, if there is
one.</p>

<p>(9) The best verse in the chapter. Mark it
and memorize it.</p>

<p>(10) Write down what new truth you have
learned from the chapter.</p>

<p>(11) Write down what truth already known
has come to you with new power.</p>

<p>(12) What definite thing have you resolved to
do as a result of studying this chapter. It would
be well to study in this way, all the chapters in
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Acts; the first
eight chapters of Romans; 1 Cor. 12, 13 and 15;
first six chapters of 2 Corinthians; all the chapters
in Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, First
Thessalonians and First Epistle of John. It
would be well at times to vary this by taking up
other methods of study for a time.</p>

<p>Another profitable method of Bible study is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
topical method. This was Mr. Moody’s favourite
method of study. Take up the great topics
of which the Bible teaches such as, the Holy
Spirit, Prayer, the Blood of Christ, Sin, Judgment,
Grace, Justification, the New Birth, Sanctification,
Faith, Repentance, the Character of
Christ, the Resurrection of Christ, the Ascension
of Christ, the Second Coming of Christ, Assurance,
Love of God, Love (to God, to Christ, to
Christians, to all men), Heaven, Hell. Get a Bible
text-book and go through the Bible on each one
of these topics. (Other methods of Bible study,
and more thorough methods for the advanced
student, will be found in the author’s book “<span class="smcap">How
to Study the Bible for Greatest Profit</span>.”)</p>

<p>3. We should <i>study the Bible comprehensively</i>—the
whole Bible. Many who read their
Bibles make the great mistake of confining all
their reading to certain portions of the Bible that
they enjoy, and in this way they get no knowledge
of the Bible as a whole. They miss altogether
many of the most important phases of
Bible truth. Begin and go through the Bible
again and again—a certain portion each day from
the Old Testament and a portion from the New
Testament. Read carefully at least one Psalm
every day.</p>

<p>It is well oftentimes to read a whole book of
the Bible through at a single sitting. Of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with a few books of the Bible this would take
one or two hours, but with most of the books of
the Bible it can be done in a few minutes. With
the shorter books of the Bible they should be
read through again and again at a single sitting.</p>

<p>4. <i>Study the Bible attentively.</i> Do not hurry.
One of the worst faults in Bible study is haste
and heedlessness. The Bible only does good by
the truth that it contains. It has no magic
power. It is better to read one verse attentively
than to read a dozen chapters thoughtlessly.
Sometimes you will read a verse that takes hold
of you. Don’t hurry on. Linger and ponder
that verse. As you read, mark in your Bible
what impresses you most. One does not need
an elaborate system of Bible marking, simply
mark what impresses you. Meditate upon what
you mark. God pronounces that man blessed
who “meditates” in God’s law day and night
(Ps. 1: 2). It is wonderful how a verse of
Scripture will open if one reads it over and over
again and again, paying attention to each word
as he reads it, trying to get its exact meaning
and its full meaning. Memorize the passages
that impress you most (Ps. 119: 11, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>).
When you memorize a passage of Scripture,
memorize its location as well as its words. Fix
in your mind chapter and verse where the words
are found. A busy but spiritually-minded man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
who was hurrying to catch a train once said to
me, “Tell me in a word how to study my
Bible.” I replied, “Thoughtfully.”</p>

<p>5. <i>Study your Bible comparatively.</i> That is
compare Scripture with Scripture. The best
commentary on the Bible is the Bible itself.
Wherever you find a difficult passage in the
Bible, there is always some passage elsewhere
that explains its meaning. The best book to
use in this comparison of Scripture with Scripture
is “The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge.”
On every verse in the Bible this book gives a
large number of references. It is well to take
up some book of the Bible and go through that
book verse by verse, looking up carefully and
studying every reference given in “The Treasury
of Scripture Knowledge.” This is a very fruitful
method of Bible study. It is also well in studying
the Bible by chapters to look up the references
on the more important verses in the chapter.
One will get more light on passages of Scripture
by looking up the references given in “The
Treasury of Scripture Knowledge,” than in any
other way I know.</p>

<p>6. <i>Study your Bible believingly.</i> The Apostle
Paul in writing to the Christians in Thessalonica
says, “For this cause also thank we God without
ceasing, because, when ye received the Word of
God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the Word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word
of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
believe” (1 Thess. 2: 13). Happy is the one
who receives the Word of God as these believers
in Thessalonica received it, who receives it as
what it really is, the Word of God. In such a
one it “works effectually.” The Bible is the
Word of God and we get the most out of any
book by studying it as what it really is. It is
often said that we should study the Bible just as
we study any other book. That principle contains
a truth, but it also contains a great error.
The Bible, it is true, is a book as other books are
books, the same laws of grammatical and literary
construction hold here as in other books, but the
Bible is a unique book. It is what no other
book is, the Word of God. This can be easily
proven to any candid man.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Bible ought then
to be studied as no other book is. It should be
studied as the Word of God. This involves five
things:</p>

<p>(1) A greater eagerness and more careful and
candid study to find out just what it teaches than
is bestowed upon all other books. It is important
to know the mind of man. It is absolutely
essential to know the mind of God. The place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to discover the mind of God is the Bible. This
is the book in which God reveals His mind.</p>

<p>(2) A prompt and unquestioning acceptance
of, and submission to its teachings when definitely
ascertained. These teachings may appear to us
unreasonable or impossible, nevertheless we should
accept them. If this book is the Word of God,
how foolish it is to submit its teachings to the
criticism of our finite reasoning. A little boy
who discredits his wise father’s statements simply
because to his infant mind they appear unreasonable,
is not a philosopher, but a fool. But the
greatest of human thinkers is only an infant compared
with the infinite God. And to discredit
God’s statements found in His Word because
they appear unreasonable to our infantile minds
is not to act the part of the philosopher, but the
part of a fool. When we are once satisfied that
the Bible is the Word of God, its clear teachings
must be for us the end of all controversy and
discussion.</p>

<p>(3) Absolute reliance upon all its promises in
all their length and breadth and depth and height.
The one who studies the Bible as the Word of
God will say of any promise, no matter how vast
and beyond belief it appears, “God who cannot
lie has promised this, so I will claim it for myself.”
Mark the promise you thus claim. Look
each day for some new promise from your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
infinite Father. He has put “His riches in
glory” at your disposal (Phil. 4: 19). I know
of no better way to grow rich spiritually than to
search daily for promises, and when you find
them appropriate them to yourself.</p>

<p>(4) Obedience. Be a doer of the Word and
not a hearer only deceiving your own soul
(James 1: 22). Nothing goes farther to help
one understand the Bible than the purpose to
obey it. Jesus said, “If any man willeth to do
His will, he shall know of the teaching” (John
7: 17 <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>). The surrendered will means the clear
eye. If our eye is single (that is, our will is absolutely
surrendered to God) our whole body shall
be full of light. But if our eye be evil (that is,
if we are trying to serve two masters and are not
absolutely surrendered to one Master, God) our
whole body shall be full of darkness (Matt.
6: 22-24). Many a passage that looks obscure
to you now would become as clear as day if you
were willing to obey in all things what the Bible
teaches. Each commandment discovered in the
Bible that is really intended as a commandment
to us should be obeyed instantly. It is remarkable
how soon one loses his relish for the Bible
and how soon the mind becomes obscured to its
teachings when we disobey the Bible at any
point. Many a time I have known persons who
have loved their Bibles and have been useful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
God’s service and clear in their views of the
truth who have come to something in the Bible
that they were unwilling to obey, some sacrifice
was demanded that they were unwilling to make,
and their love for the Bible has rapidly waned,
their faith in the Bible began to weaken, and
soon they were drifting farther and farther away
from clear views of the truth. Nothing clears
the mind like obedience; nothing darkens the
mind like disobedience. To obey a truth you
see prepares you to see other truths. To disobey
a truth you see darkens your mind to all
truths.</p>

<p>Cultivate prompt, exact, unquestioning, joyous
obedience to every command that it is evident
from its context applies to you. Be on the lookout
for new orders from your King. Blessing
lies in the direction of obedience to them. God’s
commands are but sign-boards that mark the road
to present success and blessedness and to eternal
glory.</p>

<p>(5) Studying the Bible as the Word of God
involves studying it as His own voice speaking
directly to you. When you open the Bible to
study realize that you have come into the very
presence of God and that now He is going to
speak to you. Realize that it is God who is
talking to you as much as if you saw Him standing
there. Say to yourself, “God is now going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to speak to me.” Nothing goes farther to give
a freshness and gladness to Bible study than the
realization that as you read God is actually talking
to you. In this way Bible study becomes
personal companionship with God Himself. That
was a wonderful privilege that Mary had one day,
of sitting at the feet of Jesus and listening to His
voice, but if we will study the Bible as the Word
of God and as if we were in God’s very presence,
then we shall enjoy the privilege of sitting
at the feet of God and having Him talk to us
every day. How often what would otherwise be
a mere mechanical performance of a duty would
become a wonderfully joyous privilege if one
would say as he opens the Bible, “Now God,
my Father, is going to speak to me.” Oftentimes
it helps us to a realization of the presence
of God to read the Bible on our knees. The
Bible became in some measure a new book to
me when I took to reading it on my knees.</p>

<p>7. <i>Study the Bible prayerfully.</i> God, who is
the author of the Bible, is willing to act as interpreter
of it. He does so when you ask Him to.
The one who prays with earnestness and faith
the Psalmist’s prayer, “Open Thou mine eyes
that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy
law” (Ps. 119: 18) will get his eyes opened to
see new beauties and wonders in the Word of
God that he never dreamed of before. Be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
definite about this. Each time you open the
Bible to study it, even though it is but for a few
minutes, ask God to give you an open and discerning
eye, and expect Him to do it. Every
time you come to a difficulty in the Bible, lay it
before God and ask an explanation and expect
it. How often we think as we puzzle over hard
passages, “Oh, if I only had some great Bible
teacher here to explain this to me!” God is
always present. He understands the Bible better
than any human teacher. Take your difficulty
to Him and ask Him to explain it. Jesus said,
“When He the Spirit of Truth is come, He shall
guide you into all the truth” (John 16: 13, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>).
It is the privilege of the humblest believer in
Christ to have the Holy Spirit for his guide in
his study of the Word. I have known many
very humble people, people with almost no education,
who got more out of their Bible study
than most of the great theological teachers that
I have known; simply because they had learned
that it was their privilege to have the Holy Spirit
for their teacher as they studied the Bible. Commentaries
on the Bible are oftentimes of great
value, but one will learn more of real value from
the Bible by having the Holy Spirit for his
teacher when he studies his Bible than he will
from all the commentaries that were ever published.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>8. <i>Improve spare moments for Bible study.</i>
In almost every man’s life many minutes each
day are lost, while waiting for meals, riding on
trains, going from place to place in street-cars
and so forth. Carry a pocket Bible or Testament
with you and save these golden moments
by putting them to the very best use, listening
to the voice of God.</p>

<p>9. <i>Store away the Scripture in your mind and
heart.</i> It will keep you from sin (Ps. 119: 11,
<span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>); from false doctrine (Acts 20: 29, 30, 32;
2 Tim. 3: 13-15). It will fill your heart with joy
(Jer. 15: 16); and peace (Ps. 85: 8). It will give
you victory over the evil one (1 John 2: 14); it
will give you power in prayer (John 15: 7); it
will make you wiser than the aged and your
enemies (Ps. 119: 98, 100, 130); it will make you
“complete, furnished completely unto every good
work” (2 Tim. 3: 16, 17, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>). Try it. Do
not memorize at random but memorize Scripture
in a connected way; memorize texts bearing on
various subjects in proper order; memorize by
chapter and verse that you may know where to
put your finger on the text if any one disputes it.
You should have a good Bible for your study.
One of the best is “The Oxford Two Version
Bible, Workers’ Edition.”</p>

<span class="smaller">DIFFICULTIES IN THE BIBLE</span></h2>

<p>Sooner or later every young Christian comes
across passages in the Bible which are hard to
understand and difficult to believe. To many a
young Christian, these difficulties become a
serious hindrance in the development of their
Christian life. For days and weeks and months
oftentimes faith suffers partial or total eclipse.
At just this point wise counsel is needed. We
have no desire to conceal the fact that these
difficulties exist. We rather desire to frankly
face and consider them. What shall we do concerning
these difficulties that every thoughtful
student of the Bible will sooner or later encounter.</p>

<p>1. <i>The first thing we have to say about these
difficulties is that from the very nature of the case
difficulties are to be expected.</i> Some people are
surprised and staggered because there are difficulties
in the Bible. I would be more surprised
and more staggered if there were not. What is
the Bible? It is a revelation of the mind and
will and character and being of the infinitely
great, perfectly wise, and absolutely holy God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
But to whom is this revelation made? To men
and women like you and me, to finite beings.
To men who are imperfect in intellectual development
and consequently in knowledge, and
in character and consequently in spiritual discernment.</p>

<p>There must, from the very necessities of the
case, be difficulties in such a revelation made to
such persons. When the finite tries to understand
the infinite there is bound to be difficulty.
When the ignorant contemplate the utterances
of one perfect in knowledge there must be many
things hard to be understood and some things
which to their immature and inaccurate minds
appear absurd. When sinful beings listen to the
demands of an absolutely holy being they are
bound to be staggered at some of His demands,
and when they consider His dealings they are
bound to be staggered at some of His dealings.
These dealings will necessarily appear too severe,
stern, harsh, terrific. It is plain that there must
be difficulties for us in such a revelation as the
Bible is proven to be. If some one should hand
me a book that was as simple as the multiplication
table and say, “This is the Word of God, in
which He has revealed His whole will and wisdom,”
I would shake my head and say, “I cannot
believe it. That is too easy to be a perfect
revelation of infinite wisdom.” There must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in any complete revelation of God’s mind and
will and character and being, things hard for a
beginner to understand, and the wisest and best
of us are but beginners.</p>

<p>2. <i>The second thing to be said about these
difficulties is that a difficulty in a doctrine,
or a grave objection to a doctrine, does not in
any wise prove the doctrine to be untrue.</i> Many
thoughtless people fancy that it does. If they
come across some difficulty in the way of
believing in the divine origin and absolute
inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible, they at
once conclude that the doctrine is exploded.
That is very illogical. Stop a moment and
think and learn to be reasonable and fair.
There is scarcely a doctrine in science commonly
believed to-day that has not had some great
difficulty in the way of its acceptance. When
the Copernican theory, now so universally accepted,
was first proclaimed, it encountered a
very grave difficulty. If this theory were true
the planet Venus should have phases as the
moon has. But no phases could be discovered
by the best glass then in existence. But the
positive argument for the theory was so strong
that it was accepted in spite of this apparently
unanswerable objection. When a more powerful
glass was made, it was discovered that Venus had
phases after all. The whole difficulty arose, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
all those in the Bible arise, from man’s ignorance
of some of the facts in the case. According to
the common sense logic recognized in every department
of science, if the positive proof of a
theory is conclusive, it is believed by rational
men, in spite of any number of difficulties in
minor details. Now the positive proof that the
Bible is the Word of God, that it is an absolutely
trustworthy revelation from God Himself of
Himself, His purposes and His will, of man’s
duty and destiny, of spiritual and eternal realities,
is absolutely conclusive. Therefore every
rational man and woman must believe it in spite
of any number of difficulties in minor details.
He is a shallow thinker who gives up a well-attested
truth because of some facts which he
cannot reconcile with that truth. And he is a
very shallow Bible scholar who gives up the
divine origin and inerrancy of the Bible because
there are some supposed facts that he cannot
reconcile with that doctrine.</p>

<p>3. <i>The third thing to be said about the difficulties
in the Bible is that there are many more
and much greater difficulties in the way of a
doctrine that holds the Bible to be of human
origin, and hence fallible, than are in the way of
the doctrine that holds the Bible to be of divine
origin and hence altogether trustworthy.</i> A man
may bring you some difficulty and say, “How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
do you explain that if the Bible is the Word of
God?” and perhaps you may not be able to answer
him satisfactorily. Then he thinks he has
you, but not at all. Turn on him and ask him
how do you account for the fulfilled prophecies
of the Bible if it is of human origin? How do
you account for the marvellous unity of the
Book? How do you account for its inexhaustible
depth? How do you account for its unique
power in lifting men up to God? How do you
account for the history of the Book, its victory
over all men’s attacks, etc., etc., etc. For every
insignificant objection he can bring to your view,
you can bring many deeply significant objections
to his view, and no candid man will have any
difficulty in deciding between the two views.
The difficulties that confront one who denies
that the Bible is of divine origin and authority
are far more numerous and weighty than those
that confront the ones who believes it is of
divine origin and authority.</p>

<p>4. <i>The fourth thing to be said about the difficulties
in the Bible is the fact that you cannot
solve a difficulty does not prove that it cannot be
solved, and the fact that you cannot answer an
objection does not prove at all that it cannot be
answered.</i> It is passing strange how often we
overlook this very evident fact. There are many
who, when they meet a difficulty in the Bible and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
give it a little thought and can see no possible
solution, at once jump at the conclusion that a
solution is impossible by any one, and so throw
up their faith in the reliability of the Bible and in
its divine origin. A little more of that modesty
that is becoming in beings so limited in knowledge
as we all are would have led them to say,
“Though I see no possible solution to this difficulty,
some one a little wiser than I might easily
find one.” Oh! if we would only bear in mind
that we do not know everything, and that there
are a great many things that we cannot solve now
that we could easily solve if we only knew a little
more. Above all, we ought never to forget that
there may be a very easy solution to infinite
wisdom of that which to our finite wisdom—or
ignorance—appears absolutely insoluble. What
would we think of a beginner in algebra who,
having tried in vain for half an hour to solve a
difficult problem, declared that there was no possible
solution to the problem because he could
find none? A man of much experience and
ability once left his work and came a long distance
to see me in great perturbation of spirit
because he had discovered what seemed to him a
flat contradiction in the Bible. It had defied all
his attempts at reconciliation, but in a few moments
he was shown a very simple and satisfactory
solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i>The fifth thing to be said about the difficulties
in the Bible is that the seeming defects in the
book are exceedingly insignificant when put in
comparison with its many and marvellous excellencies.</i>
It certainly reveals great perversity
of both mind and heart that men spend so much
time expatiating on the insignificant points that
they consider defects in the Bible, and pass by
absolutely unnoticed the incomparable beauties
and wonders that adorn and glorify almost every
page. What would we think of any man, who
in studying some great masterpiece of art, concentrated
his entire attention upon what looked
to him like a fly-speck in the corner. A large
proportion of what is vaunted as “critical study
of the Bible” is a laborious and scholarly investigation
of supposed fly-specks and an entire neglect
of the countless glories of the book.</p>

<p>6. <i>The sixth thing to be said about the difficulties
in the Bible is that the difficulties in the
Bible have far more weight with superficial readers
of it than with profound students.</i> Take a
man who is totally ignorant of the real contents
and meaning of the Bible and devotes his whole
strength to discovering apparent inconsistencies
in it, to such superficial students of the Bible
these difficulties seem of immense importance;
but to the one who has learned to meditate on
the Word of God day and night they have scarce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
any weight at all. That mighty man of God,
George Müller, who had carefully studied the
Bible from beginning to end more than a hundred
times, was not disturbed by any difficulties
he encountered. But to the one who is reading
it through carefully for the first or second time
there are many things that perplex and stagger.</p>

<p>7. <i>The seventh thing to be said about the difficulties
in the Bible is that they rapidly disappear
upon careful and prayerful study.</i> How many
things there are in the Bible that once puzzled
us and staggered us that have been perfectly
cleared up, and no longer present any difficulty
at all! Is it not reasonable to suppose that the
difficulties that still remain will also disappear
upon further study?</p>

<p>How shall we deal with the difficulties which
we do find in the Bible?</p>

<p>1. First of all, <i>honestly</i>. Whenever you find
a difficulty in the Bible, frankly acknowledge it.
If you cannot give a good honest explanation,
do not attempt as yet to give any at all.</p>

<p>2. <i>Humbly.</i> Recognize the limitations of
your own mind and knowledge, and do not
imagine there is no solution just because you
have found none. There is in all probability a
very simple solution. You will find it some
day, though at present you can find no solution
at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Determinedly.</i> Make up your mind that
you will find the solution if you can by any
amount of study and hard thinking. The difficulties
in the Bible are your heavenly Father’s
challenge to you to set your brains to work.</p>

<p>4. <i>Fearlessly.</i> Do not be frightened when
you find a difficulty, no matter how unanswerable
it appears upon first glance. Thousands have
found such before you. They were seen hundreds
of years ago and still the Old Book stands.
You are not likely to discover any difficulty that
was not discovered and probably settled long before
you were born, though you do not know
just where to lay your hand upon the solution.
The Bible which has stood eighteen centuries of
rigid examination and incessant and awful assault,
is not going under before any discoveries that
you make or any attacks of modern infidels.
All modern infidel attacks upon the Bible are
simply a revamping of old objections that have
been disposed of a hundred times in the past.
These old objections will prove no more effective
in their new clothes than they did in the cast-off
garments of the past.</p>

<p>5. <i>Patiently.</i> Do not be discouraged because
you do not solve every problem in a day. If
some difficulty defies your best effort, lay it aside
for awhile. Very likely when you come back to
it, it will have disappeared and you will wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
how you were ever perplexed by it. The writer
often has to smile to-day when he thinks how
sorely he was perplexed in the past over questions
which are now as clear as day.</p>

<p>6. <i>Scripturally.</i> If you find a difficulty in
one part of the Bible, look for other Scripture to
throw light upon it and dissolve it. Nothing
explains Scripture like Scripture. Never let
apparently obscure passages of Scripture darken
the light that comes from clear passages, rather
let the light that comes from the clear passage
illuminate the darkness that seems to surround
the obscure passage.</p>

<p>7. <i>Prayerfully.</i> It is wonderful how difficulties
dissolve when one looks at them on his
knees. One great reason why some modern
scholars have learned to be destructive critics is
because they have forgotten how to pray.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="IX">IX<br />
<span class="smaller">PRAYER</span></h2>

<p>The one who would succeed in the Christian
life must lead a life of prayer. Very much of
the failure in Christian living to-day, and in
Christian work, results from neglect of prayer.
Very few Christians spend as much time in
prayer as they ought. The Apostle James told
believers in his day that the secret of the poverty
and powerlessness of their lives and service was
neglect of prayer. “Ye have not,” says God
through the Apostle James, “because ye ask
not.” So it is to-day. Why is it, many a Christian
is asking, that I make such poor headway in
my Christian life? Why do I have so little victory
over sin? Why do I accomplish so little by
my effort? and God answers, “You have not because
you ask not.”</p>

<p>It is easy enough to lead a life of prayer if one
only sets about it. Set apart some time each day
for prayer. The rule of David and of Daniel is
a good one; three times a day. “Evening and
morning and at noon,” says David, “will I pray
and cry aloud and He shall hear my voice”
(Ps. 55: 17). Of Daniel we read, “Now when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he
went into his house; and his windows being
open in his chamber towards Jerusalem, he
kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and
prayed, and gave thanks before his God as he did
aforetime” (Dan. 6: 10). Of course, one can
pray while walking the street, or riding in the
car, or sitting at his desk, and one should learn
to lift his heart to God right in the busiest moments
of his life, but we need set times of prayer,
times when we go alone with God, shut to the
door and talk to our Father in the secret place
(Matt. 6: 6). God is in the secret place and will
meet with us there and listen to our petitions.</p>

<p>Prayer is a wonderful privilege. It is an audience
with the King. It is talking to our Father.
How strange it is that people should ask the
question, “How much time ought I to spend in
prayer?” When a subject is summoned to an
audience with his king, he never asks, “How
much time must I spend with the king?” His
question is rather, “How much time will the king
give me?” And with any true child of God
who realizes what prayer really is, that it is an
audience with the King of Kings, the question
will never be, “How much time must I spend in
prayer,” but “How much time may I spend in
prayer with a due regard to other duties and
privileges?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Begin the day with thanksgiving and prayer.
Thanksgiving for the definite mercies of the past,
prayer for the definite needs of the present day.
Think of the temptations that you are likely to
meet during the day; ask God to show you the
temptations that you are likely to meet and get
from God strength for victory over these temptations
before the temptations come. The reason
why many fail in the battle is because they wait
until the hour of battle. The reason why others
succeed is because they have gained their victory
on their knees long before the battle came. Jesus
conquered in the awful battles of Pilate’s judgment
hall and of the cross because He had the
night before in prayer anticipated the battle and
gained the victory before the struggle really
came. He had told His disciples to do the same.
He had bidden them “Pray that ye enter not
into temptation” (Luke 22: 40), but they had
slept when they ought to have prayed, and when
the hour of temptation came they fell. Anticipate
your battles, fight them on your knees before
temptation comes and you will always have
victory. At the very outset of the day, get
counsel and strength from God Himself for the
duties of the day.</p>

<p>Never let the rush of business crowd out
prayer. The more work that any day has to do,
the more time must be spent in prayer in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>preparation
for that work. You will not lose time by
it, you will save time by it. Prayer is the greatest
time saver known to man. The more the
work crowds you the more time take for
prayer.</p>

<p>Stop in the midst of the bustle and hurry and
temptation of the day for thanksgiving and
prayer. A few minutes spent alone with God at
midday will go far to keep you calm in the midst
of the worries and anxieties of modern life.</p>

<p>Close the day with thanksgiving and prayer.
Review all the blessings of the day and thank
God in detail for them. Nothing goes farther to
increase faith in God and in His Word than a
calm review at the close of each day of what God
has done for you that day. Nothing goes further
towards bringing new and larger blessings from
God than intelligent thanksgiving for blessings
already granted.</p>

<p>The last thing you do each day ask God to
show you if there has been anything in the day
that has been displeasing in His sight. Then
wait quietly before God and give God an opportunity
to speak to you. Listen. Do not be in
a hurry. If God shows you anything in the day
that has been displeasing in His sight, confess it
fully and frankly as to a holy and loving Father.
Believe that God forgives it all, for He says He
does (1 John 1: 9). Thus at the close of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
day all your accounts with God will be straightened
out. You can lie down and sleep in the
glad consciousness that there is not a cloud between
you and God. You can arise the next
day to begin life anew with a clean balance sheet.
Do this and you can never backslide for more
than twenty-four hours. Indeed, you will not
backslide at all. It is very hard to straighten out
accounts in business that have been allowed to
get crooked through a prolonged period. No
bank ever closes its business day until its balance
is found to be absolutely correct. And no Christian
should close a single day until his accounts
with God for that day have been perfectly adjusted
alone with Him.</p>

<p>There should be special prayer in special
temptation—that is when we see the temptation
approaching. If you possibly can, get at once
alone somewhere with God and fight your battle
out. Keep looking to God. “Pray without ceasing”
(1 Thess. 5: 17). It is not needful to be
on your knees all the time but the heart should
be on its knees all the time. We should be
often on our knees or on our faces literally. This
is a joyous life, free from worry and care. “In
nothing be anxious; but in everything by
prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let
your request be made known unto God, and the
peace of God which passeth all understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
shall guard your hearts and thoughts in Christ
Jesus” (Phil. 4: 6, 7, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>).</p>

<p>There are three things for which one who
would succeed in the Christian life must especially
pray. 1. For wisdom. “If any of you
lack wisdom (and we all do) let him ask of God”
(James 1: 5). 2. For strength. “For they
that wait upon the Lord shall renew their
strength” (Is. 40: 31). 3. For the Holy Spirit.
“Your heavenly Father shall give the Holy
Spirit to them that ask Him” (Luke 11: 13).
Even if you have received the Holy Spirit,
you should constantly pray for a new filling
with the Holy Spirit and definitely expect to
receive it. We need a new filling with the
Spirit for every new emergency of Christian life
and Christian service. The Apostle Peter was
baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit on the
Day of Pentecost (Acts 2: 1-4) but he was filled
anew in Acts 4: 8 and Acts 4: 31. There are
many Christians in the world who once had a
very definite baptism with the Holy Spirit and
had great joy and were wonderfully used, but
who have tried to go ever since in the power of
that baptism received years ago, and to-day their
lives are comparatively joyless and powerless.
We need constantly to get new supplies of oil
for our lamps. We get these new supplies of
oil by asking for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not enough that we have our times of
secret prayer to God alone with Him, we also
need fellowship with others in prayer. If they
have a prayer-meeting in your church attend it
regularly. Attend it for your own sake; attend
it for the sake of the church. If it is a prayer-meeting
only in name and not in fact, use your
influence quietly and constantly (not obtrusively)
to make it a real prayer-meeting. Keep the
prayer-meeting night sacredly for that purpose.
Refuse all social engagements for that night. A
major-general in the United States army once
took command of the forces in a new district.
A reception was arranged for him for a certain
night in the week. When he was informed of
this public reception he replied that that was
prayer-meeting night and everything else had to
give way for prayer-meeting, that he could not
attend the reception on that night. That general
had proved himself a man that can be depended
upon. The Church of Christ in America
owes more to him than to almost any other
officer in the American army. Ministers learn
to depend upon their prayer-meeting members.
The prayer-meeting is the most important meeting
in the church. If your church has no
prayer-meeting, use your influence to have one.
It does not take many members to make a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
prayer-meeting. You can start with two but
work for many.</p>

<p>It is well to have a little company of Christian
friends with whom you are in real sympathy and
with whom you meet regularly every week
simply for prayer. There has been nothing of
more importance in the development of my own
spiritual life of recent years than a little prayer-meeting
of less than a dozen friends who have
met every Saturday night for years. We met
and together we waited upon God. If my life
has been of any use to the Master, I attribute it
largely to that prayer-meeting. Happy is the
young Christian that has a little band of friends
like that that meet together regularly for prayer.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="X">X<br />
<span class="smaller">WORKING FOR CHRIST</span></h2>

<p>One of the important conditions of growth
and strength in the Christian life is work. No
man can keep up his physical strength without
exercise and no man can keep up his spiritual
strength without spiritual exercise, <i>i. e.</i>, without
working for his Master. The working Christian is
the happy Christian. The working Christian is
the strong Christian. Some Christians never
backslide because they are too busy about their
Master’s business to backslide. Many professed
Christians do backslide because they are too idle
to do anything but backslide. Jesus said to the
first disciples, “Follow Me and I will make you
fishers of men” (Matt. 4: 19). Any one who is
not a fisher of men is not following Christ.
Bearing fruit in bringing others to the Saviour
is the purpose for which Jesus has chosen us and
is one of the most important conditions of power
in prayer. Jesus says in John 15: 16, “Ye have
not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and ordained
you <i>that ye should go and bring forth
fruit</i>, and that your fruit should remain, <i>that
whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
name He may give it you</i>.” These words of
Jesus are very plain. They tell us that the one
who is bearing fruit is the one who can pray in
the name of Christ and get what he asks in that
name. In the same chapter Jesus tells us that
bearing fruit in His strength is the condition of
fullness of joy. He says, “These things have I
spoken unto you (that is, the things about abiding
in Him and bearing fruit in His strength)
that My joy might remain in you and that your
joy might be full” (John 15: 11). Experience
abundantly proves the truth of these words of
our Master. Those who are full of activity in
winning others to Christ are those who are full
of joy in Christ Himself.</p>

<p>If you wish to be a happy Christian; if you
wish to be a strong Christian, if you wish to be
a Christian who is mighty in prayer, begin at
once to work for the Master and never let a day
pass without doing some definite work for Him.
But how can a young Christian work for Him?
How can a young Christian bear fruit? The
answer is very simple and very easy to follow.
You can bear fruit for your Master by going to
others and telling them what your Saviour has
done for you, and by urging them to accept this
same Saviour and showing them how to do it.
There is no other work in the world that is so
easy to do, so joyous, and so abundant in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
fruitfulness, as personal hand to hand work. The
youngest Christian can do personal work. Of
course, he cannot do it so well as he will do it
later, after he has had more practice. But the
way to learn how to do it is by doing it. I have
known thousands of Christians all around the
world who have begun to work for Christ, and
to bring others to Christ, the very day that they
were converted. How often young men and
young women, yes, and old men and old women
too, have come to me and said, “I accepted Jesus
Christ last night as my Saviour, my Lord and
my King, and to-night I have led a friend to
Christ.” Then the next day they would come
and tell me of some one else they had led to
Christ. When we were in Sheffield, a young
man working in a warehouse accepted Christ.
Before the month’s mission in Sheffield was over
he had led thirty others to Christ, many of them
in the same warehouse where he himself worked.
This is but one instance among many. There
are many books that tell how to do personal
work.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>But one does not need to wait until they have
read some book on the subject before they begin.
One of the commonest and greatest mistakes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
is made is that of frittering one’s life away in
getting ready to get ready to get ready. Some
never do get ready. The way to get ready is to
begin at once. Make up your mind that you
will speak about accepting Christ to at least one
person every day. Early in his Christian life
Mr. Moody made this resolution that he would
never let a day pass over his head without speaking
to at least one person about Christ. One
night he was returning late from his work. As
he got near home it occurred to him that he had
not spoken to any one that day. He said to
himself, “It is too late now. I will not get an
opportunity. Here will be one day gone without
my speaking to any one about Christ.” But
a little ways ahead of him he saw a man standing
under a lamp-post. He said, “Here is my last
opportunity.” The man was a stranger to him,
though he knew who Mr. Moody was. Mr.
Moody hurried up to him and asked him, “Are
you a Christian?” The man replied, “That is
none of your business. If you were not a sort
of a preacher I would knock you into the gutter.”
But Mr. Moody spoke a few faithful words to
him and passed on. The next day this man
called on one of Mr. Moody’s business friends in
Chicago in great indignation. He said, “That
man Moody of yours over on the Northside is
doing more harm than he is good. He has zeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
without knowledge. He came up to me last
night, a perfect stranger, and asked me if I was
a Christian. He insulted me. I told him if
he had not been a sort of preacher I would have
knocked him into the gutter.” Mr. Moody’s
friend called him in and said to him, “Moody,
you are doing more harm than good. You have
zeal without knowledge. You insulted a friend
of mine on the street last night.” Mr. Moody
went out somewhat crestfallen, feeling that perhaps
he was doing more harm than good, that
perhaps he did have zeal without knowledge.
But some weeks after, late at night, there was a
great pounding on his door. Mr. Moody got
out of bed and rushed to the door supposing
that the house was on fire. That same man
stood at the door. He said, “Mr. Moody, I
have not had a night’s rest since you spoke to
me that night under the lamp-post and I have
come around for you to tell me what to do to be
saved.” Mr. Moody had the joy that night of
leading that man to Christ. It is better to have
zeal without knowledge than to have knowledge
without zeal, but it is better yet to have zeal
with knowledge, and any one may have this.
The way to get knowledge is by experience, and
the way to get experience is by doing the work.
The man who is so afraid of making blunders
that he never does anything, never learns anything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
The man who goes ahead and does his
best and is willing to risk the blunders, is the
man who learns to avoid the blunders in the
future. Some of the most gifted men I have
ever known have never really accomplished anything,
they were so fearful of making blunders.
Some of the most useful men I have ever known
were men who at the outset were the least promising,
but who had a real love for souls and went
on, at first in a blundering way, but they blundered
on until they learned by experience to do
things well. Do not be discouraged by your
blunders. Pitch in and keep pegging away.
Every honest mistake is but a stepping-stone to
future success. Try every day to lead some one
else to Christ. Of course, you will not succeed
every day, but the work will do you good any
way, and years after you will often find that
where you thought you have made the greatest
blunders, you have accomplished the best results.
The man who gets angriest at you, will often
turn out in the end the man who is most grateful
to you. Be patient and hope on. Never be
discouraged.</p>

<p>Make a prayer list. Go alone with God.
Write down at the top of a sheet of paper,
“God helping me, I promise to pray daily and
to work persistently for the conversion of the following
persons.” Then kneel down and ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
God to show you who to put on that list. Do
not make the list so long that your prayer and
work become mechanical and superficial. After
you have made the list keep your covenant,
really pray for them every day. Watch for opportunities
to speak to them—improve these
opportunities. You may have to watch long for
your opportunities with some of them, and you
may have to speak often, but never give up. I
prayed about fifteen years for one man, one of
the most discouraging men I ever met, but I saw
that man converted at last, and I saw him a
preacher of the gospel, and many others were
converted through his preaching, and now he is
in the Glory.</p>

<p>Learn to use tracts. Get a few good tracts
that are fitted to meet the needs of different
kinds of people. Then hand these tracts out to
the people whose needs they are adapted to meet.
Follow your tracts up with prayer and with personal
effort.</p>

<p>Go to your pastor and ask him if there is some
work he would like to have you do for him in
the church. Be a person that your pastor can
depend upon. We live in a day in which there
are many kinds of work going on outside the
church, and many of these kinds of work are
good and you should take part in them as you
are able, but never forget that your first duty is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to the church of which you are a member. Be a
person that your pastor can count on. It may
be that your pastor may not want to use you,
but at least give him the chance of refusing you.
If he does refuse you, don’t be discouraged, but
find work somewhere else. There is plenty to
do and few to do it. It is as true to-day as it was
in the days of our Saviour, “The harvest truly is
plenteous but the labourers are few” (Matt. 9: 37),
“Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest that He
will send forth labourers into His harvest,” and
pray that He will send you (Matt. 9: 38). The
right kind of men are needed in the ministry. The
right kind of men and women are needed for foreign
mission work, but you may not be the right kind
of a man or woman for foreign missionary work,
but none the less there is work for you to do just
as important in its place as the work of the minister
or the missionary is. See that you fill your
place and fill it well.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h2 id="XI">XI<br />
<span class="smaller">FOREIGN MISSIONS</span></h2>

<p>In order to have the largest success in the
Christian life one must be interested in foreign
missions. The last command of our Lord before
leaving this earth was, “Go ye therefore, and
make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them
into the name of the Father, and of the Son and
of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all
things whatsoever I have commanded you: and
lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the
world” (Matt. 28: 19, 20, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>). Here is a command
and a promise. It is one of the sweetest
promises in the Bible. But the enjoyment of the
promise is conditioned upon obedience to the
command. Our Lord commands every one of
His disciples to go and “make disciples” of all
the nations. This command was not given to the
apostles alone, but to every member of Christ’s
church in all ages. If we go, then Christ will be
with us even unto the end of the age; but, if we
do not go, we have no right to count upon His
companionship. Are you going? How can we
go? There are three ways in which we can go,
and in at least two of these ways we must go if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
we are to enjoy the wonderful privilege of the
personal companionship of Jesus Christ every
day unto the end of the age.</p>

<p>1. First, <i>many of us can go in our own persons</i>.
Many of us ought to go. God does not
call every one of us to go as foreign missionaries,
but He does call many of us to go who are not
responding to the call. Every Christian should
offer himself for the foreign field and leave the
responsibility of choosing him or refusing him
to the all-wise One, God Himself. No Christian
has a right to stay at home until he has gone and
offered himself definitely to God for the foreign
field. If you have not done it before, do it to-day.
Go alone with God and say, “Heavenly
Father, here I am, Thy property, purchased by
the precious blood of Christ. I belong to Thee.
If Thou dost wish me in the foreign field, make
it clear to me and I will go.” Then keep watching
for the leading of God. God’s leading is
clear leading. He is light and in Him is no
darkness at all (1 John 1: 5). If you are really
willing to be led, He will make it clear as day.
Until He does make it clear as day, you need
have no morbid anxiety that perhaps you are
staying at home when you ought to go to the
foreign field. If He wants you, He will make it
clear as day in His own way and time. If He
does make it clear, then prepare to go step by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
step as He leads you. And when His hour
comes, go, no matter what it costs. If He does
not make it clear that you ought to go in your
own person, stay at home and do your duty at
home and go in the other ways that will now be
told.</p>

<p>2. <i>We all can go, and all ought to go to the
foreign field by our gifts.</i> There are many who
would like to go to the foreign field in their own
person, but whom God providentially prevents,
but who are still going in the missionaries they
support or help to support. It is possible for
you to preach the Gospel in the remotest corners
of the earth by supporting or helping to support
a foreign missionary or a native worker in that
place. Many who read this book are able financially
to support a foreign missionary out of their
own pocket. If you are able to do it, do it. If
you are not able to support a foreign missionary,
you may be able to support a native helper—do
it. You may be able to support one missionary
in Japan and another in China, and another in
India and another in Africa and another somewhere
else—do it. Oh! the joy of preaching the
Gospel in lands that we shall never see with our
own eyes. How few in the church of Christ to-day
realize their privilege of preaching the Gospel
and saving men and women and children in distant
lands by sending substitute missionaries to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
them, that is, by sending some one that goes
for you where you cannot go yourself. They
could not go but for your gifts by which they
are supported and you could not go but for them,
by their going in your place. You may be able
to give but very little to foreign missions, but
every little counts. Many insignificant streams
together make a mighty river. If you cannot be
a river, at least be a stream.</p>

<p>Learn to give largely. The large giver is the
happy Christian. “The liberal soul shall be
made fat” (Prov. 11: 25). “He which soweth
sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he which
soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully,”
and “God is able to make all grace abound towards
you, that ye, always having all sufficiency in all
things may abound to every good work” (2 Cor.
9: 8, 9). Success and growth in the Christian life
depend upon few things more than upon liberal
giving. The stingy Christian cannot be a growing
Christian. It is wonderful how a Christian
man begins to grow when he begins to give.
Power in prayer depends on liberality in giving.
One of the most wonderful statements about
prayer and its answers is 1 John 3: 22. John
says there that, whatsoever he asked of God he
received; and he tells us why, because he on his
part, kept God’s commandments and did those
things which were pleasing in His sight, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
immediate context shows that the special commandments
he was keeping were the commandments
about giving. He tells us in the twenty-first
verse that when our heart condemns us not
in the matter of giving then have we confidence
in our prayers to God. God’s answers to our
prayers come in through the same door that our
gifts go out to others, and some of us open the
door such a little ways by our small giving that
God is not able to pass in to us any large answers
to our prayers. One of the most remarkable
promises in the Bible is that found in Phil. 4: 19,
“My God shall supply (<span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>, fulfill, that is fill
full) all your need according to His riches in glory
by Christ Jesus,” but this promise was made to
believers who had distinguished themselves above
their fellows by the largeness and the frequency
of their giving (Cf. vs. 14-18). Of course, we
should not confine our giving to foreign missions.
We should give to the work of the home church:
we should give to rescue work in our large cities.
We should do good to all men as we have opportunity,
especially to those who are of the household
of faith (Gal. 6: 10). But foreign missions
should have a large part in our gifts.</p>

<p>Give systematically. Set aside for Christ a
fixed proportion of all the money or goods you
get. Be exact and honest about it. Don’t use
that part of your income for yourself under any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
circumstances. The Christian is not under law,
and there is no law binding on the Christian that
he should give a tenth of his income, but as a
matter of free choice and glad gratitude a tenth
is a good proportion to begin with. Don’t let
it be less than a tenth. God required that of the
Jews and the Christian ought not to be more
selfish than a Jew. After you have given your
tenth, you will soon learn the joy of giving free
will offerings in addition to the tenth.</p>

<p>3. But there is another way in which we can
go to the foreign field, that is by our prayers.
We can all go in this way. Any hour of the day
or night you can reach any corner of the earth
by your prayers. I go to Japan, to China and
to Australia and to Tasmania and to New Zealand
and to India and to Africa and to other parts of
the earth every day, by my prayers. And prayer
really brings things to pass where you go. Do
not make prayer an excuse for not going in your
own person if God wishes you, and do not make
prayer an excuse for small giving. There is no
power in that kind of prayer. If you are ready
to go yourself if God wishes you, and if you are
actually going by your gifts as God gives you
ability, then you can go effectually by your
prayers also. The greatest need of the work of
Jesus Christ to-day is prayer. The greatest need
of foreign missions to-day is prayer. Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
missions are a success, but they are no such success
as they ought to be and might be. They
are no such success as they would be if Christians
at home, as well as abroad, were living up to the
full measure of their opportunity in prayer.</p>

<p>Be definite in your prayers for foreign missions.
Pray first of all that God will send forth labourers
into His harvest, the right sort of labourers.
There are many men and women in the foreign
field that ought never to have gone there. There
was not enough prayer about it. More foreign
missionaries are greatly needed, but only more
of the right kind of missionaries. Pray to God
daily and believingly to send forth labourers into
the harvest.</p>

<p>Pray for the labourers who are already on the
field. No class of men and women need our
prayers more than foreign missionaries. No
class of men and women are objects of more
bitter hatred from Satan than they. Satan delights
to attack the reputation and the character
of the brave men and women who have gone
to the front in the battle for Christ and the
Truth. No persons are subjected to so numerous
and to such subtle and awful temptations as
foreign missionaries. We owe it to them to
support them by our prayers. Do not merely
pray for foreign missionaries in general. Have
a few special missionaries of whose work you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
make a study that you may pray intelligently
for them.</p>

<p>Pray for the native converts. We Christians
at home think we have difficulties and trials and
temptations and persecutions, but the burdens
that we have to bear are nothing to what the
converts in heathen lands have to bear. The
obstacles oftentimes are enormous and discouragements
crushing. Christ alone can make
them stand, but He works in answer to the
prayers of His people. Pray often, pray earnestly,
pray intensely and pray believingly for
native converts. How wonderfully God has
answered prayer for native converts we are
beginning to learn from missionary literature.
It is well to be definite here again and to have
some definite field about whose needs you keep
yourself informed and pray for the converts of
that field. Do not have so many that you become
confused and mechanical. Pray for conversions
in the foreign field. Pray for revivals
in definite fields. The last few years have been
years of special prayer for special revival in
foreign fields and from every corner of the earth
tidings have come of how amazingly God is answering
these prayers. But the great things that
God is beginning to do are small indeed in comparison
with what He will do if there is more
prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XII">XII<br />
<span class="smaller">COMPANIONS</span></h2>

<p>Our companions have a great deal to do with
determining our character. The companionships
that we form create an intellectual, moral and
spiritual atmosphere that we are constantly
breathing, and our spiritual health is helped or
hindered by it. Every young Christian should
have a few wisely chosen friends, intimate friends,
with whom he can talk freely. Search out for
yourself a few persons of about your own age
with whom you can associate intimately. Be
sure that they are spiritual persons in the best
sense. Persons who love to study the Bible,
persons who love to converse on spiritual themes,
persons who know how to pray and do pray,
persons who are really working to bring others
to Christ.</p>

<p>Do not be at all uneasy about the fact that
some Christian people are more agreeable to you
than others. God has made us in that way.
Some are attracted to some persons and some
to others, and it proves nothing against the
others and nothing against yourself that you are
not attracted to them as you are to some people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Cultivate the friendship of those whose friendship
you find helpful to your own spiritual life.</p>

<p>On the other hand avoid the companionships
that you find spiritually and morally hurtful. Of
course, we are not to withdraw ourselves utterly
from unconverted people, or even of very bad
people. We are to cultivate oftentimes the
acquaintance of unspiritual people, and even of
very bad people, in order that we may win them
for Christ; but we must always be on our guard
in such companionships to bear always in mind
to seek to lift them up or else they will be sure
to drag us down. If you find in spite of all your
best effort that any companionship is doing harm
to your own spiritual life, then give it up. Some
people are surrounded with such an atmosphere
of unbelief or cynicism or censoriousness or impurity
or greed or some other evil thing that it
is impossible to associate with them to any large
extent without being contaminated. In such a
case, the path of wisdom is plain; stop associating
with them to any large extent. Stop associating
with them at all except in so far as there is
some prospect of helping them.</p>

<p>But there are other companionships that
mould our lives besides the companionships of
living persons. The books that we read are our
companions. They exert a tremendous influence
for good or for evil. There is nothing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
will help us more than a good book, and there is
nothing that will hurt us more than a bad book.
Among the most helpful books are the biographies
of good men. Read again and again
the lives of such good and truly great men as
Wesley and Finney and Moody. We live in a
day in which good biographies abound. Read
them. Well written histories are good companions.
No study is more practical and instructive
than the study of history, and it is not
only instructive but spiritually helpful if we only
watch to see the hand of God in history, to see
the inevitable triumph of right and the inevitable
punishment of wrong in individuals and in nations.</p>

<p>Some few books of fiction are helpful, but here
one needs to be very much on his guard. A
large portion of modern fiction is positively pernicious
morally. Books of fiction that are not
positively bad, at least give false views of life and
unfit one for life as it really is. Much reading
of fiction is mentally injurious. The inveterate
novel reader ruins his powers of close and clear
thinking. Fiction is so fascinating that it always
tends to drive out other reading that is more
helpful mentally and morally. We should be on
our guard in even reading good literature, that
the good does not crowd out the best; that is
that the best of man’s literature does not crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
out the very best of all—God’s Book. God’s
Book, the Bible, must always have the first place.</p>

<p>Then there is another kind of companionship
that has a tremendous influence over our lives,
that is the companionship of pictures. The
pictures that we see every day of our lives, and
the pictures that we see only occasionally, have
a tremendous power in the shaping of our lives.
A mother had two dearly loved sons. It was
her dream and ambition that these sons should
enter the ministry, but both of them went to sea.
She could not understand it until a friend one
day called her attention to the picture of a magnificent
ship in full sail careening through the
ocean that hung above the mantel in the dining-room.
Every day of their lives her boys had
gazed upon that picture, had been thrilled by it,
and an unconquerable love for the sea and longing
for it had thus been created and this had
determined their lives. How many a picture
that is a masterpiece of art, but in which there is
an evil suggestion, has sent some young men on
the road to ruin. Many of our art collections
are so polluted with improper pictures that it is
not safe for a young man or a young woman to
visit them. The evil thought that they suggest
may be but for a moment, and yet Satan will
know how to bring that picture back again and
again and work injury by it. Don’t look for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
moment at any picture, no matter how praised by
art critics, that taints your imagination with evil
suggestion. Avoid as you would poison every
painting, or engraving, every etching, every
photograph that leaves a spot of impurity on
your mind, but feast your soul upon the pictures
that make you holier, kinder, more sympathetic
and more tender.</p>

<h2 id="XIII">XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">AMUSEMENTS</span></h2>

<p>Young people need recreation. Our Saviour
does not frown upon wholesome recreation. He
was interested in the games of the children when
He was here upon earth. He watched the
children at their play (Matt. 12: 16-19), and He
watches the children at their play to-day, and delights
in their play when it is wholesome and
elevating. In the stress and strain of modern life
older people too need recreation if they are to do
their very best work. But there are recreations
that are wholesome, and there are amusements
that are pernicious. It is impossible to take up
amusements one by one, and it is unnecessary.
A few principles can be laid down.</p>

<p>1. <i>Do not indulge in any form of amusement
about whose propriety you have any doubts.</i>
Whenever you are in doubt, always give God
the benefit of the doubt. There are plenty of
recreations about which there can be no question.
“He that doubteth is condemned: for whatsoever
is not of faith is sin” (Rom. 14: 32, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>). Many
a young Christian will say, “I am not sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
this amusement is wrong.” Are you sure it is
right? If not, leave it alone.</p>

<p>2. <i>Do not indulge in any amusement that you
cannot engage in to the glory of God.</i> “Whether
therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
all to the glory of God” (1 Cor. 10: 31). Whenever
you are in doubt as to whether you should
engage in any amusement ask yourself, Can I do
this at this time to the glory of God?</p>

<p>3. <i>Do not engage in any amusement that will
hurt your influence with anybody.</i> There are
amusements, which perhaps are all right in themselves,
but which we cannot engage in without
losing our influence with some one. Now every
true Christian wishes his life to tell with everybody
to the utmost. There is so much to be
done and so few to do it that every Christian
desires every last ounce of power for good that
he can have with everybody, and, if any amusement
will injure your influence for good with
any one, the price is too great. Do not engage
in it. A Christian young lady had a great
desire to lead others to Christ. She made up
her mind that she would speak to a young friend
of hers about coming to Christ, and while resting
between the figures of a dance she said to the
young man who was her companion in the
dance, “George, are you a Christian?” “No,”
he said, “I am not, are you?” “Yes,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
replied, “I am.” “Then,” he said, “what are
you doing here?” Whether justly or unjustly
the world discounts the professions of those
Christians who indulge in certain forms of the
world’s own amusements. We cannot afford to
have our professions thus discounted.</p>

<p>4. <i>Do not engage in any amusement that you
cannot make a matter of prayer</i>, that you cannot
ask God’s blessing upon. Pray before your play
just as much as you would pray before your
work.</p>

<p>5. <i>Do not go to any place of amusement
where you cannot take Christ with you, and
where you do not think Christ would feel at home.</i>
Christ went to places of mirth when He was here
upon earth. He went to the marriage feast in
Cana (John 2), and contributed to the joy of the
occasion, but there are many modern places of
amusement where Christ would not be at home.
Would the atmosphere of the modern stage be
congenial to that holy One whom we call
“Lord”? If it would not, don’t you go.</p>

<p>6. <i>Don’t engage in any amusement that you
would not like to be found enjoying if the Lord
should come.</i> He may come at any moment.
Blessed is that one whom when He cometh, He
shall find watching and ready, and glad to open
to Him immediately (Luke 12: 36, 40). I have
a friend who was one day walking down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
street thinking upon the return of his Lord. As
he thought he was smoking a cigar. The
thought came to him, “Would you like to meet
Christ now with that cigar in your mouth?” He
answered honestly, “No, I would not.” He
threw that cigar away and never lighted another.</p>

<p>7. <i>Do not engage in any amusement, no matter
how harmless it would be for yourself, that
might harm some one else.</i> Take for example
card playing. It is probable that thousands have
played cards moderately all their lives and never
suffered any direct moral injury from it, but every
one who has studied the matter knows that cards
are the gamblers’ chosen tools. He also knows
that most, if not all, gamblers took their first
lessons in card playing at the quiet family card
table. He knows that if a young man goes out
into the world knowing how to play cards and
indulging at all in this amusement that before
long he is going to be put into a place where he
is going to be asked to play cards for money,
and if he does not consent he will get into serious
trouble. Card playing is a dangerous amusement
for the average young man. It is pretty
sure to lead to gambling on a larger or a smaller
scale, and one of the most crying social evils of
our time is the evil of gambling. Some young
man may be encouraged to play cards by your
playing who will afterwards become a gambler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and part of the responsibility will lie at your
door. If I could repeat all the stories that have
come to me from broken-hearted men whose
lives have been shipwrecked at the gaming table;
if I could tell of all the broken-hearted mothers
who have come to me, some of them in high
position, whose sons have committed suicide at
Monte Carlo and other places, ruined by the
cards, I think that all thoughtful and true Christians
would give them up forever.</p>

<p>For most of us the recreations that are most
helpful are those that demand a considerable outlay
of physical energy. Recreations that take
us into the open air, recreations that leave us
refreshed in body and invigorated in mind.
Physical exercises of the strenuous kind, but
not over-exercise, is one of the great safeguards
of the moral conduct of boys and young men.
There is very little recreation in watching others
play the most vigorous game of football but
there is real health for the body and for the soul
in a due amount of physical exercise for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XIV">XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">PERSECUTION</span></h2>

<p>One of the discouragements that meets every
true Christian before he has gone very far in the
Christian life is persecution. God tells us in His
Word that “All that will live godly in Christ
Jesus shall suffer persecution” (2 Tim. 3: 12).
Sooner or later every one who surrenders absolutely
to God and seeks to follow Jesus Christ in
everything will find that this verse is true. We
live in a God-hating world and in a compromising
age. The world’s hatred of God in our
day is veiled. It does not express itself in our
land in the same way that it expressed itself in
Palestine in the days of Jesus Christ, but the
world hates God to-day as much as it ever did,
and it hates the one who is loyal to Christ. It
may not imprison him or kill him but in some
way it will persecute him. Persecution is inevitable
for a loyal follower of Jesus Christ. Many
a young Christian when he meets with persecution
is surprised and discouraged and not a few
fall away. Many a one seems to run well for a
few days but like those of whom Jesus spoke,
“They have no root in themselves, but endure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
for a while; then when tribulation or persecution
ariseth because of the Word straightway they
stumble” (Mark 4: 17). I have seen many an
apparently promising Christian life brought to
an end in this way. But if persecution is rightly
received, it is no longer a hindrance to the Christian
life but a help to it.</p>

<p>Do not be discouraged when you are persecuted.
No matter how fierce and hard the persecution
may be, be thankful for it. Jesus says,
“Blessed are they which are persecuted for
righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile
you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner
of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice,
and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward
in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets
which were before you” (Matt. 5: 10-12). It is
a great privilege to be persecuted for Christ and
for the truth. Peter found this out and wrote to
the Christians of his day: “Beloved, think it not
strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try
you, as though some strange thing happened
unto you. But rejoice, inasmuch, as ye are partakers
of Christ’s suffering; that, when His glory
shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
joy. If ye be reproached for the name
of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory
and of God resteth upon you: on their part He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
is evil spoken of, but on your part He is glorified”
(1 Peter 4: 12-14). Be very sure that the
persecution is really for Christ’s sake and not
because of some eccentricity of your own, or
because of your stubbornness. There are many
who bring upon themselves the displeasure of
others because they are stubborn and cranky
and then flatter themselves that they are being
persecuted for Christ’s sake and for righteousness’
sake. Be considerate of the opinions of
others and be considerate of the conduct of
others. Be sure that you do not push your
opinions upon others in an unwarrantable way,
or make your conscience a rule of life for other
people. But never yield a jot of principle. Stand
for what you believe to be the truth. Do it in
love, but do it at any cost. And if when you
are standing for conviction and principle you are
disliked for it and slandered for it and treated
with all manner of unkindness because of it, do
not be sad but rejoice. Do not speak evil of
those who speak evil of you, “because Christ
also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that
ye should follow His steps: who, when He was
reviled, reviled not again, when He suffered, He
threatened not; but committed Himself to Him
that judgeth righteously” (1 Peter 2: 21, 23).</p>

<p>At this point many a Christian makes a mistake.
He stands loyally for the truth, but he receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the persecution that comes for the truth
with harshness, he grows bitter, he gets to condemning
every one but himself. There is no
blessing in bearing persecution in that way.
Persecution should be borne meekly, lovingly,
serenely. Don’t talk about your own persecutions.
Rejoice in them. Thank God for them,
and go on obeying God. And don’t forget to
love and pray for them who persecute you
(Matt. 5: 44).</p>

<p>If at any time the persecution seems harder
than you can bear, remember how abundant the
reward is, “If we suffer, we shall also reign with
Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us”
(2 Tim. 2: 12). Every one must enter into the
kingdom of God through much tribulation (Acts
14: 22), but do not go back on that account.
Remember always however fiercely the fire of
persecution may burn, “That the sufferings of
this present time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory which shall be revealed in us”
(Rom. 8: 18). Remember too that your light
affliction is but for the moment, and that it worketh
out for you “a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory” (2 Cor. 4: 17). Keep looking,
not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen, for the things which are seen
are but for a time, but the things which are not
seen are for eternity (2 Cor. 4: 18). When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
apostles were persecuted, even unto imprisonment
and stripes, they departed from the presence
of the council that had ordered their terrible
punishment, rejoicing that they were counted
worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus, and
they continued daily in the temple and every
house teaching and preaching Jesus Christ (Acts
5: 40-42).</p>

<p>The time may come when you think that you
are being persecuted more than others, but you
do not know what others may have to endure.
Even if it were true,—that you were being persecuted
more than any one else, you ought not
to complain but to humbly thank God that He
has bestowed upon you such an honour. Keep
your eyes fixed upon “Jesus, the Author and Finisher
of our faith; who for the joy that was set
before Him endured the cross, despising the
shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
throne of God. For consider Him that endured
such contradiction of sinners against Himself,
lest ye be wearied and faint in your mind”
(Heb. 12: 2, 3). I was once talking with an old
coloured man who in the slave days had found
his Saviour. The cruel master had him flogged
again and again for his loyalty to Christ but he
said to me, “I simply thought of my Saviour
dying on the cross in my place, and I rejoiced to
suffer persecution for Him.”</p>

<h2 id="XV">XV<br />
<span class="smaller">GUIDANCE</span></h2>

<p>I have met a great many who are trying to
lead a Christian life who are much troubled over
the question of guidance. They wish to do the
will of God in all things, but what puzzles them
is to tell what the will of God may be in every
case. When any one starts out with the determination
to obey God in everything and to be
led by the Holy Spirit, Satan seeks to trouble
him by perplexing him as to what the will of God
is. Satan comes and suggests that something is
the will of God that is probably not the will of
God at all, and then when he does not do it, Satan
says, “There you disobeyed God.” In this way,
many a conscientious young Christian gets into
a very morbid and unhappy state of mind, fearing
that he has disobeyed God and has lost His
favour. This is one of the most frequent devices
of the devil to keep Christians from being
cheerful.</p>

<p>How may we know the will of God?</p>

<p>First of all let me say that a true Christian life
is not a life governed by a whole lot of rules about
what one shall eat, and what one shall drink, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
what one shall do, and what one shall not do.
A life governed by a lot of rules is a life of bondage.
One is sure sooner or later to break some
of these man-made rules and to get into condemnation.
Paul tells us in Rom. 8: 15, “Ye
have not received the spirit of bondage again to
fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption
(placing us a son), whereby we cry, Abba,
Father.” The true Christian life is the life of a
trusting, glad, fear-free child; not led by rules,
but led by the personal guidance of the Holy
Spirit who dwells within us. “As many as are
led by the Spirit of God these are sons of God”
(Rom. 8: 14, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>). If you have received the
Holy Spirit, He dwells within you and is ready
to lead you at every turn of life. A life governed
by a multitude of rules is a life of bondage
and anxiety. A life surrendered to the control
of the Holy Spirit is a life of joy and peace and
freedom. There is no anxiety in such a life,
there is no fear in the presence of God. We
trust God and rejoice in His presence just as a
true child trusts his earthly father and rejoices in
his presence. If we make a mistake at any point,
even if we disobey God, we go and tell Him all
about it as trustfully as a child and know that He
forgives us and that we are restored at once to
His full favour (1 John 1: 9).</p>

<p>But how can we tell the Holy Spirit’s guidance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
that we may obey Him and thus have God’s
favour at every turn of life? This question is
answered in James 1: 5-7, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>, “But if any of
you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who
giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it
shall be given him, but let him ask in faith, nothing
doubting: for he that doubteth is like the
surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.
For let not that man think that he shall receive
anything of the Lord.” This is very simple. It
includes five points.</p>

<p>(1) That you recognize your own ignorance
and your own inability to guide your own life—that
you lack wisdom.</p>

<p>(2) The surrender of your will to God, and a
real desire to be led by Him.</p>

<p>(3) Definite prayer to Him for guidance.</p>

<p>(4) Confident expectation that God will guide
you. You “ask in faith, nothing doubting.”</p>

<p>(5) That you follow step by step as He
guides. God may only show you a step at a
time. That is enough. All you need to know
is the next step. It is here that many make a
mistake. They wish God to show them the
whole way before they take the first step. A
university student once came to me over the
question of guidance. He said, “I cannot find
out the will of God. I have been praying but
God does not show me His will.” This was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the month of July. I said, “About what is it
that you are seeking to know the will of God?”
“About what I should do next summer.” I
said, “Do you know what you ought to do to-morrow?”
“Yes.” “Do you not know what
you ought to do next autumn?” “Yes, finish
my course. But what I want to know is what I
ought to do when my university course is over.”
He was soon led to see that all he needed to
know for the present was what God had already
shown him. That when he did that, God
would show him the next step. Do not worry
about what you ought to do next week. Do
what God shows you you ought to do to-day.
Next week will take care of itself. Indeed, to-morrow
will take care of itself. Obey the Spirit
of God for to-day. “Be not therefore anxious
for the morrow; for the morrow will be anxious
for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
is the evil thereof” (Matt. 6: 34, <span class="smcapuc">R. V.</span>). It is
enough to live a day at a time, if we do our
very best for that day.</p>

<p>God’s guidance is clear guidance, “God is light
and in Him is no darkness at all” (1 John 1: 5).
Do not be anxious over obscure leadings. Do
not let your soul be ruffled by the thought,
“Perhaps this obscure leading is what God wants
me to do.” Obscure leadings are not divine
leadings. God’s path is as clear as day. Satan’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
path is full of obscurity and uncertainty and
anxiety and questioning. If there comes some
leading of which you are not quite sure whether
it is the will of God or not, simply go to your
Heavenly Father and say, “Heavenly Father, I
desire to know Thy will. I will do Thy will if
Thou wilt make it clear. But Thou art light
and in Thee is no darkness at all. If this is Thy
will make it clear as day and I will do it.” Then
wait quietly upon God and do not act until God
makes it clear, but the moment it is made clear,
act at once.</p>

<p>The whole secret of guidance is an absolutely
surrendered will, a will that is given up to God
and ready to obey Him at any cost. Many of
our uncertainties about God’s guidance are
simply because we are not really willing to do
what God is really guiding us to do. We are
tempted to say, “I cannot find out what God’s
will is,” when the real trouble is we have found
out His will and it is something we do not wish
to do and we are trying to make ourselves think
that God wants us to do something else.</p>

<p>All supposed leadings of God should be tested
by the Word of God. The Bible is God’s
revealed will. Any leading that contradicts the
plain teaching of the Bible is certainly not the
leading of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit
does not contradict Himself. A man once came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to me and said that God was leading him to
marry a certain woman. He said that she was
a very devoted Christian woman and they had
been greatly drawn towards one another and they
felt that God was leading them to be married.
But I said to the man, “You already have a
wife.” “Yes,” he said, “but we have never
lived happily and we have not lived together for
years.” “But,” I replied, “that does not alter
the case. God in His Word has told us distinctly
the duty of the husband to the wife and
how wrong it is in His sight for a husband to
divorce his wife and marry another.” “Yes,”
said the man, “but the Holy Spirit is leading us
to one another.” I indignantly replied that
“Whatever spirit is leading you to marry one
another, it is certainly not the Holy Spirit but
the spirit of the evil one. The Holy Spirit
never leads any one to disobey the Word of
God.”</p>

<p>In seeking to know the guidance of the Spirit
always search the Scriptures, study them prayerfully.
Do not make a book of magic out of the
Bible. Do not ask God to show you His will
and then open your Bible at random and put
your finger upon some text and take it out of
its connection without any relation to its real
meaning and decide the will of God in that way.
This is an irreverent and improper use of Scripture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
You may open your Bible at just the
right place to find right guidance, but if you do,
it will not be by some fanciful interpretation of
the passage you find. It will be by taking the
passage in its context and interpreting it to mean
just what it says as seen in its context. All sorts
of mischief has arisen from using the Bible in
this perverse way. I knew an earnest Christian
woman once who was somewhat concerned
about the predictions made by a false prophetess
that Chicago was to be destroyed on a certain
day. She opened her Bible at random. It
opened to the twelfth chapter of Ezekiel, “Son
of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink
thy water with trembling and with carefulness.…
And the cities that are inhabited
shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate”
(Ezek. 12: 18, 20). Now this seemed to
exactly fit the case and the woman was considerably
impressed, but if the verses had been studied
in their connection, it would have been evident
at once that God was not speaking about Chicago
and that they were not applicable to Chicago.
It was not an intelligent study of the Word of
God and therefore led to a false conclusion.</p>

<p>To sum up, lead a life not led by rules but by
the personal guidance of the Holy Spirit. Surrender
your will absolutely to God. Whenever
you are in doubt as to His guidance, go to Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and ask Him to show you His will, expect Him
to do it, follow step by step as He leads. Test
all the leadings by the plain and simple teachings
of the Bible. Live free from anxiety and worry
lest in some unguarded moment you have not
done the right thing.</p>

<p>After you have done what you think God led
you to do, do not be always going back and
wondering whether you did the right thing.
You will get into a morbid state if you do. If
you really wished to do God’s will and sought
His guidance, and did what you thought He
guided you to do, you may rest assured you did
the right thing, no matter what the outcome has
been. Satan is bound that we shall not be
happy, cheerful Christians if he can prevent it,
but God wishes us to be happy, cheerful, bright
Christians every day and every hour. He does
not wish us to brood but to rejoice (Phil. 4: 4).
A most excellent Christian man came to me
one Monday morning in great gloom over the
failures of the work of the preceding day. He
said to me, “I made wretched work of teaching
my Sunday-school class yesterday.” I said,
“Did you honestly seek wisdom from God before
you went to your class?” He said, “I did.” I
said, “Did you expect to receive it?” He said,
“I did.” “Then,” I said, “in the face of God’s
promise what right have you to doubt that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
did give you wisdom?” (James 1: 5-7). His
gloom disappeared and he looked up with a
smile and said, “I had no right to doubt.” Let
us learn to trust God. Let us remember that if
our wills are surrendered to Him He is ever
more willing to guide us than we are to be guided.
Let us trust that He does guide us at every step
and even though what we do does not turn out
as we expected, let us never brood over it but
trust God. Let us walk in the light of simple
trust in God. In this way we shall be glad and
peaceful and strong and useful at every turn of
life.</p>

<p>12mo, Cloth, net $1.00.</p>

<p class="right up"><b>PEYTON H. HOGE</b></p>

<p>The author’s ambition is “to tell in the most vivid and practical
form for men living in the world to-day the story of Jesus of Nazareth
in its culminating scenes.” One could exhaust adjectives in praise of
the author’s management of the dramatic form and his blank verse.
It is a wonderful work. The dedicatory poem alone is of such surpassing
beauty that one will never forget it.</p>

<h4>The Directory of the Devout Life</h4>

<p>A Commentary on the Sermon on the Mount.</p>

<p>12mo, Cloth, net $1.00.</p>

<p class="right up"><b>F. B. MEYER, M.A.</b></p>

<p>“In many respects the best writings Mr. Meyer has issued. They
are eminently practical, and the pointed and piercing ideas of the
Master are explained and brought home to personal character and life
in an illuminating and stimulating way.”—<i>Watchman.</i></p>

<h4>With the Sorrowing</h4>

<p>A Pastor’s Handbook.</p>

<p>16mo, Cloth flex., net 75 cts.</p>

<p class="right up">Edited by <b>F. W. PALMER</b></p>

<p>Presented with confidence to pastors, missionaries and other visitors
in the homes of sorrow, as likely to prove a most valuable aid in
their trying experiences. Although primarily a service book for
funerals, it is vastly more than this. With Scripture selections of exceptional
suggestive values and a collection of poems of comfort both
rare and striking the little volume will be greatly prized.</p>

<h3>DEVOTIONAL STUDIES.</h3>

<h4>The Christ of To-Day</h4>

<p>What? Whence? Whither?</p>

<p>16mo, Boards, net 50c.</p>

<p class="right up"><b>G. CAMPBELL MORGAN</b></p>

<p>A study originally presented from the platform of the Northfield
Conferences, awakening exceptional interest at the time. No more

<h4>The Redeemed Life After Death</h4>

<p>16mo, Boards, net 50c.</p>

<p class="right up"><b>CHARLES CUTHBERT HALL</b></p>

<p>Not a new theory of Immortality or a review of old theories, but a
presentation with rare literary charm and with the comprehension of
wide scholarship, of the grip of the Christian heart upon the life to
come. It will comfort and assure the sorrowing, guide and convince
the inquiring.</p>

<h4>Moments of Silence</h4>

<p>12mo, Cloth, net $1.25.</p>

<h4>Yet Another Day</h4>

<p>32mo, Cloth, net 25c. Leather, net 35c.</p>

<p class="right up"><b>J. H. JOWETT, M.A.</b></p>

<p>A brief prayer for every day of the year, and it is not too much to
say that, although scarcely any one of them contains one hundred
words and most of them far less, they will drive straight to the heart
as nothing that ever came from Mr. Jowett’s pen. It is an extraordinary
little book, the flower of the sweetest, open eyed love of Christ.
The impression of a single page is indelible.</p>

<h4>The Inner Chamber of the Inner Life</h4>

<p>12mo, Cloth, net 75c.</p>

<p class="right up"><b>ANDREW MURRAY</b></p>

<p>12mo, Cloth, net $1.00.</p>

<p class="right up"><b>MARSHALL P. TALLING, PH.D.</b></p>

higher lines. In the present book, true prayer is shown to be an
approach from both the human and the divine sides.”—<i>The Westminster.</i></p>

<h4>Bible Etchings of Immortality</h4>

<p>12mo, Cloth, decorated, net 50c.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
